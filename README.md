<details><summary>What is the diference between struct and class?</summary>
An  enum  is an object type whose instances represent  distinct  predefined  alternative values. Think of it as a list of known possibilities. An enum is the Swift way to express a set of constants that are alternatives to one another. An enum declaration includes case statements. Each case is the name of one of the alternatives. An instance of an enum will represent exactly one alternative — one case.

Methods A  method  is a function — one that happens to be declared at the top level of an object type declaration. This means that everything said about functions in  Chapter 2 applies. By default, a metho

Properties A  property  is a variable — one that happens to be declared at the top level of an object type declaration. This means that everything said about variables in  Chapter 3 applies. A property has a fixed type; it can be declared with  var  or  let; it can be stored or computed; it can have setter observers. An instance property can also be declared  lazy.

Structs A  struct  is the Swift object type  par excellence. An enum, with its fixed set of cases, is a reduced, specialized kind of object. A class, at the other extreme, will often turn out to be overkill; it has some features that a struct lacks, but if you don’t need those features, a struct may be preferable.

Classes A  class  is similar to a struct, with the following key differences: Reference type Classes are reference types. This means, among other things, that a class instance has two remarkable features that are not true of struct instances or enum instances: Mutability A class instance is mutable in place. Even if your reference to an instance of a class is a constant (let), you can change the value of an instance property through that reference. An instance method of a class never has to be marked  mutating  (and cannot be). Multiple references When a given instance of a class is assigned to multiple variables or passed as argument to a function, you get multiple references to  one and the same object. Inheritance A class can have a superclass. A class that has a superclass is a  subclass  of that superclass. Class types can thus form a hierarchical tree. In Objective-C, classes are the only object type. Some built-in Swift struct types are magically bridged to Objective-C class types, but your custom struct types don’t have that magic. Thus, when programming iOS with Swift, a primary reason for declaring a class, rather than a struct, is as a form of interchange with Objective-C and Cocoa.

Value Types and Reference Types A major difference between enums and structs, on the one hand, and classes, on the other, is that enums and structs are  value types, whereas classes are  reference types. A value type is  not mutable in place, even though it seems to be. For example, consider a struct. A struct is a value type:

<details><summary>Memory Management</summary>
- Core Data
- SQL
- Realm
	

1. Semaphore — allows up to N threads to access a given region of code at a time.
2. Mutex — ensures that only one thread is active in a given region of code at a time. You can think of it as a semaphore with a maximum count of 1.
3. Spinlock — causes a thread trying to acquire a lock to wait in a loop while checking if the lock is available. It is efficient if waiting is rare, but wasteful if waiting is common.
4. Read-write lock — provides concurrent access for read-only operations, but exclusive access for write operations. Efficient when reading is common and writing is rare.
5. Recursive lock — a mutex that can be acquired by the same thread many times.

<details><summary>NSThread vs NSOperation</summary>
NSThread:

1. iOS developers have to write code for the work/process he want to perform along with for the creation and management of the threads themselves.
2. iOS developers have to be careful about a plan of action for using threads.
3. iOS developer have to manage posiable problems like reuseability of thread, lockings etc. by them self.
4. Thread will consume more memory too.

NSOperation:

1. The NSOperation class is an abstract class which encapsulates the code and data associated with a single task.
2. Developer needs to use subclass or one of the system-defined subclasses of NSOperation to perform the task.
3. Add operations into NSOperationQueue to execute them.
4. The NSOperationQueue creates a new thread for each operation and runs them in the order they are added.
5. Operation queues handle all of the thread management, ensuring that operations are executed as quickly and efficiently as possible.
6. An operation queue executes operations either directly by running them on secondary threads or indirectly using GCD (Grand Central Dispatch).
7. It takes care of all of the memory management and greatly simplifies the process.
8. If you don’t want to use an operation queue, you can also execute an operation by calling its start method. It may make your code too complex.

  <details><summary> Explain NSURLSession?</summary>
  The NSURLSession class and related classes provide an API for downloading content via HTTP. This API provides a rich set of delegate methods for supporting authentication and gives your app the ability to perform background downloads when your app is not running or, in iOS, while your app is suspended.

To use the NSURLSession API, your app creates a series of sessions, each of which coordinates a group of related data transfer tasks. For example, if you are writing a web browser, your app might create one session per tab or window. Within each session, your app adds a series of tasks, each of which represents a request for a specific URL (and for any follow-on URLs if the original URL returned an HTTP redirect).

Like most networking APIs, the NSURLSession API is highly asynchronous. If you use the default, system-provided delegate, you must provide a completion handler block that returns data to your app when a transfer finishes successfully or with an error. Alternatively, if you provide your own custom delegate objects, the task objects call those delegates' methods with data as it is received from the server (or, for file downloads, when the transfer is complete).

Note: Completion callbacks are primarily intended as an alternative to using a custom delegate. If you create a task using a method that takes a completion callback, the delegate methods for response and data delivery are not called.
The NSURLSession API provides status and progress properties, in addition to delivering this information to delegates. It supports canceling, restarting (resuming), and suspending tasks, and it provides the ability to resume suspended, canceled, or failed downloads where they left off.</details>
  <details> 
  <summary> Explain types of NSURLSession?</summary>
  The NSURLSession API supports three types of sessions, as determined by the type of configuration object used to create the session:

- Default sessions : behave similarly to other Foundation methods for downloading URLs. They use a persistent disk-based cache and store credentials in the user's keychain.

- Ephemeral sessions : do not store any data to disk; all caches, credential stores, and so on are kept in RAM and tied to the session. Thus, when your app invalidates the session, they are purged automatically.

- Background sessions : are similar to default sessions, except that a separate process handles all data transfers. Background sessions have some additional limitations.
</details>
  
  <details> 
  <summary> Explain life cycle of URL Session?</summary>
  You can use the NSURLSession API in two ways: with a system-provided delegate or with your own delegate. In general, you must use your own delegate if your app does any of the following:

- Uses background sessions to download or upload content while your app is not running.
- Performs custom authentication.
- Performs custom SSL certificate verification.
- Decides whether a transfer should be downloaded to disk or displayed based on the MIME type returned by the server or other similar criteria.
- Uploads data from a body stream (as opposed to an NSData object).
- Limits caching programmatically.
- Limits HTTP redirects programmatically.

If your app does not need to do any of these things, your app can use the system-provided delegates. Depending on which technique you choose, you should read one of the following sections:

- Life Cycle of a URL Session with System-Provided Delegates : provides a lightweight view of how your code creates and uses a URL session. You should read this section even if you intend to write your own delegate, because it gives you a complete picture of what your code must do to configure the object and use it.

- Life Cycle of a URL Session with Custom Delegates : provides a complete view of every step in the operation of a URL session. You should refer to this section to help you understand how the session interacts with its delegate. In particular, this explains when each of the delegate methods is called.

  <summary>core data and different threads</summary>

Basic rules are:

Use one NSPersistentStoreCoordinator per program not per thread.
Create one NSManagedObjectContext per thread.
Never pass an NSManagedObject on a thread to the other thread.
Instead, get the object IDs via -objectID and pass it to the other thread.
More rules:

Make sure you save the object into the store before getting the object ID. Until saved, they're temporary, and you can't access them from another thread.
And beware of the merge policies if you make changes to the managed objects from more than one thread.
NSManagedObjectContext's -mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification: is helpful.

  <summary> What steps should be accomplish in order to save/fetch an object?  </summary>
Step 1  —  Describes which entity we are working with. LEts say Person.
Step 2  —  Create the our Class(PErson) NSManagedObject. The NSManagedObject will be inserted into our managed object context later when saving.
Step 3  —  Now that we have specified our entity and created a new class(person), we need to save the person’s name. In this case, we use key value coding to set the value for our key, which is specified as “name”.
Step 4  —  At this point, it’s time to save our managedObjectContext, which persists the data to the store. If an error should occur, we catch it at this point.
- Fetch
Step 1  —  Create a fetch request. A fetch request is what we use to fetch data from our Core Data store. A fetch request can be customizable to include only the results or attributes that you need. In our case, we want to fetch all objects from the Person entity.
Step 2  —  We now try to fetch data from our Core Data store and store it in our managed object context, whose job it is to create a scratchpad of sorts when dealing with managed objects.
Step 3  —  We have a simple for loop that loops through each result in our fetched items array. At this point, we print out the name of each saved object into the console.

<details><summary>nil in Swift vs nil in Objective-C? Difference?</summary>
In defintion terms:

Swift optional variable is an enum, which can have nil as a value, where as objective variable is a pointer, where nil represents, it is pointing no where.

In Usage terms:

Both are somewhat similar in the sense,

that both variables having nil value on messaging any method returns nil

Optional chaining in Swift is similar to messaging nil in Objective-C, but in a way that works for any type, and that can be checked for success or failure.
But in Safety Checking, Swift optional is the winner

As compiler does many type checking for you already, Ex. non optional parameter can't accept optional, thus you will need to unwrap it by first checking it for nil Or when you you cast any variable, it always returns an optional, thus again a safety feature at compiler level</details>

<details><summary>Nonatomic,Copy,Assign, Retain,Strong,Weak</summary>
Nonatomic

nonatomic is used for multi threading purposes. If we have set the nonatomic attribute at the time of declaration, then any other thread wanting access to that object can access it and give results in respect to multi-threading.

Copy

copy is required when the object is mutable. Use this if you need the value of the object as it is at this moment, and you don't want that value to reflect any changes made by other owners of the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it because you are retaining the copy.

Assign

Assign is somewhat the opposite to copy. When calling the getter of an assign property, it returns a reference to the actual data. Typically you use this attribute when you have a property of primitive type (float, int, BOOL...)

Retain

retain is required when the attribute is a pointer to an object. The setter generated by @synthesize will retain (aka add a retain count to) the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it. By using retain it will increase the retain count and occupy memory in autorelease pool.

Strong

strong is a replacement for the retain attribute, as part of Objective-C Automated Reference Counting (ARC). In non-ARC code it's just a synonym for retain.

This is a good website to learn about strong and weak for iOS 5. http://www.raywenderlich.com/5677/beginning-arc-in-ios-5-part-1

Weak

weak is similar to strong except that it won't increase the reference count by 1. It does not become an owner of that object but just holds a reference to it. If the object's reference count drops to 0, even though you may still be pointing to it here, it will be deallocated from memory.

  <summary>What is NSURLConnection class? Define its types and use case.</summary>
There are two ways of using NSURLConnection class. One is asynchronous and the other is synchronous.
An asynchronous connection will create a new thread and performs its download process on the new thread. A synchronous connection will block the calling thread while downloading content and doing its communication.
Many developers think that a synchronous connection blocks the main thread, which is not true. A synchronous connection will always block the thread from which it is fired. If you fire a synchronous connection from the main thread, the main thread will be blocked. But, if you fire a synchronous connection from a thread other than the main thread, it will be like an asynchronous connection and won’t block your main thread.
In fact, the only difference between a synchronous and an asynchronous connection is that at runtime, a thread will be created for the asynchronous connection while it won’t do the same for a synchronous connection.
In order to create an asynchronous connection, we need to do the following:
1. Have our URL in an instance of NSString
2. Convert our string to an instance of NSURL
3. Place our URL in a URL Request of type NSURLRequest, or in the case of mutable URLs, in an instance of NSMutableURLRequest.
4. Create an instance of NSURLConnection and pass the URL request to it.</details>
<details> 
  <summary>What is the relation between iVar and @property?</summary>
iVar is an instance variables. It cannot be accessed unless we create accessors, which are generated by @property. iVar and its counterpart @property can be of different names.
@interface Box : NSObject{
    NSString *boxName;
}
@property (strong) NSString *boxDescription;//this will become another ivar
-(void)aMethod;
@end
@implementation Box
@synthesize boxDescription=boxName;//now boxDescription is accessor for name
-(void)aMethod {
    NSLog(@"name=%@", boxName);
     NSLog(@"boxDescription=%@",self.boxDescription);
    NSLog(@"boxDescription=%@",boxDescription); //throw an error
}
@end</details>

<details> 
  <summary>What is the difference between retain & assign?</summary>
Assign creates a reference from one object to another without increasing the source’s retain count.
if (_variable != object)
{   
 [_variable release];  
  _variable = nil;  
  _variable = object;
 }
Retain creates a reference from one object to another and increases the retain count of the source object.
if (_variable != object)
{
  [_variable release];
    _variable = nil;  
_variable = [object retain];

<details> 
  <summary> What are the levels of privacy in swift 3?</summary>



Swift 3 has five levels of privacy: internal The default rule is that declarations are  internal, meaning that they are globally visible to  all code in all  files  within the containing module.  That is why Swift files within the same module can see one another’s top-level contents  automatically, with no effort on your part. (That’s different from C and Objective-C, where files can’t see each other at all unless you explicitly show them to one another through include  or  import  statements.) fileprivate  (narrower than  internal) A thing declared  fileprivate  is visible  only within its containing  file.  For example, two object types declared in the same file can see one another’s members declared  fileprivate, but code in other files cannot see those members. private  (even narrower than  fileprivate) A thing declared  private  is visible  only within its containing curly braces. In effect, the visibility of an object type’s member declared  private  is limited to code within this class declaration. (A  private  declaration at the top level of a file is equivalent to  fileprivate.) public  (wider than  internal) A thing declared  public  is visible  even outside its containing module.  Another module must first import this module before it can see anything at all. But once another module  has  imported this module, it still won’t be able to see anything in this module that hasn’t been explicitly declared public. If you don’t write any modules, you might never need to declare anything public. If you do write a module, you  must  declare  something  public, or your module is useless. open  (even wider than  public) If a class is declared  open, code in another module can subclass it; it can’t do that if the class is declared merely  public. If an open class member is declared  open, code in another module that subclasses this class can override

<details><summary>App States</summary>
### States

Apps developed for early iOS versions (before iOS 4.0) supported three states: non-running, inactive, and active. An application delegate for pre-iOS 4.0 apps received two important method calls: applicationDidFinishLaunching and applicationWillTerminate. When an app received an applicationDidFinishLaunching message, it was an opportunity for information to be retrieved from the previous launch to restore the app to its last used state. The status, applicationWillTerminate, was used to notify the app when the app was preparing to shut down. This gave the developer an opportunity to save any unsaved data or specific state information.

Currently, there are five possible application states that would be cause for the app to prepare for a transition - such as a shutdown or moving to the background. In certain cases, an app might need to continue processing in the background. However, there is certainly no reason for the app to process any graphics, animations, or display-specific routines. The five states of an iOS app - as listed in the iOS App Programming Guide - include the following:

- Non-running - The app is not running.
- Inactive - The app is running in the foreground, but not receiving events. An iOS app can be placed into an inactive state, for example, when a call or SMS message is received.
- Active - The app is running in the foreground, and receiving events.
- Background - The app is running in the background, and executing code.
- Suspended - The app is in the background, but no code is being executed.
- The seven most important application delegate methods

The operating system calls specific methods within the application delegate to facilitate transitioning to and from various states. The seven most important application delegate methods a developer should handle are:

### application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions
Method called when the launch process is initiated. This is the first opportunity to execute any code within the app.

### application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
Method called when the launch process is nearly complete. Since this method is called is before any of the app's windows are displayed, it is the last opportunity to prepare the interface and make any final adjustments.

### applicationDidBecomeActive
Once the application has become active, the application delegate will receive a callback notification message via the method applicationDidBecomeActive.

This method is also called each time the app returns to an active state from a previous switch to inactive from a resulting phone call or SMS.

### applicationWillResignActive
There are several conditions that will spawn the applicationWillResignActive method. Each time a temporary event, such as a phone call, happens this method gets called. It is also important to note that "quitting" an iOS app does not terminate the processes, but rather moves the app to the background.

### applicationDidEnterBackground
This method is called when an iOS app is running, but no longer in the foreground. In other words, the user interface is not currently being displayed. According to Apple's UIApplicationDelegate Protocol Reference, the app has approximately five seconds to perform tasks and return. If the method does not return within five seconds, the application is terminated.

### applicationWillEnterForeground
This method is called as an app is preparing to move from the background to the foreground. The app, however, is not moved into an active state without the applicationDidBecomeActive method being called. This method gives a developer the opportunity to re-establish the settings of the previous running state before the app becomes active.

### applicationWillTerminate
This method notifies your application delegate when a termination event has been triggered. Hitting the home button no longer quits the application. Force quitting the iOS app, or shutting down the device triggers the applicationWillTerminate method. This is the opportunity to save the application configuration, settings, and user preferences.

### Application state changes

Every iOS app is always in one of the five app states. The operating system manages the app state, but the app itself is responsible for managing important tasks to ensure smooth transitions between the states. Developers are required to respond appropriately to app state transitions.

With multitasking capability, the latest iOS version manages the resources available to every app. It is important to note, however, that the operating system limits what an app can do in the background. If an app needs to continue running in the background (with limited functionality), you must request permission.

### Launching the app

The moment a user taps the app icon, the app begins to change state. The app delegate receives an application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions method call, and the app state changes from non-running to inactive. Once in the inactive state, the app delegate will receive an application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method call, giving the app an opportunity to make final adjustments before the interface is displayed. If the app has not been designed to launch in the background, the operating system will activate the app, set the app state to active, and send the applicationDidBecomeActive method call to the app delegate.

### Interruptions

On occasion, the iOS app will need to respond to interruptions. An alert-based interruption - such as a phone call - causes the app to move into an inactive state. The app delegate will receive an applicationWillResignActive method call, allowing the app an opportunity to prepare for a temporary inactive state. If the user chooses to ignore the interruption, or the interrupting process has terminated, the app will move back into the active state. While making the transition from inactive to active, the app delegate will receive an applicationDidBecomeActive method call.

### Switching to the background

The iOS devices make it simple to quickly switch from app to app; when a user switches to a different app, the current app moves to the background. The app can be in one of two states: background or suspended. In either case, and before switching to the background, the app delegate receives an applicationWillResignActive method call, followed by an applicationDidEnterBackground message. If in a suspended state, the app sleeps. A background state - meaning that the app is allowed to continue executing code - requires the app to monitor and handle events. Developers need to be aware that the operating system may terminate the app at any time.#

<details><summary>Class vs Struct</summary>
	
	- Class: CALayer, CGImage, UIView
	- Struck: CGRect, CGPoint, 
	Since struct instances are allocated on stack, and class instances are allocated on heap, structs can sometimes be drastically faster.


use struct unless need to use class only features or class semantics
	ref vs value
	reference cycle
	initialisers
	inheritance
	Classes and structures in Swift have many things in common. Both can:

Define properties to store values

Define methods to provide functionality

Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax

Define initializers to set up their initial state

Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation

Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind

For more information, see Properties, Methods, Subscripts, Initialization, Extensions, and Protocols.

Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:

Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.

Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.

Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.

Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

For more information, see Inheritance, Type Casting, Deinitialization, and Automatic Reference Counting.

As a general guideline, consider creating a structure when one or more of these conditions apply:

The structure’s primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values.

It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be copied rather than referenced when you assign or pass around an instance of that structure.

Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types, which would also be expected to be copied rather than referenced.

The structure does not need to inherit properties or behavior from another existing type.

Examples of good candidates for structures include:

The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a width property and a height property, both of type Double.

A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a start property and a length property, both of type Int.

A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating x, y and z properties, each of type Double.

Extensions can add a new continuance initializer but can not add a new designated Initializer or deinit.

<details><summary>ARC</summary>
<details><summary>BonusObj</summary>	
	
- Nonatomic

nonatomic is used for multi threading purposes. If we have set the nonatomic attribute at the time of declaration, then any other thread wanting access to that object can access it and give results in respect to multi-threading.

- Copy

copy is required when the object is mutable. Use this if you need the value of the object as it is at this moment, and you don't want that value to reflect any changes made by other owners of the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it because you are retaining the copy.

- Assign

Assign is somewhat the opposite to copy. When calling the getter of an assign property, it returns a reference to the actual data. Typically you use this attribute when you have a property of primitive type (float, int, BOOL...)

- Retain

retain is required when the attribute is a pointer to an object. The setter generated by @synthesize will retain (aka add a retain count to) the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it. By using retain it will increase the retain count and occupy memory in autorelease pool.

- Strong

strong is a replacement for the retain attribute, as part of Objective-C Automated Reference Counting (ARC). In non-ARC code it's just a synonym for retain.

- what is Auto release pool?
The @autoreleasepool statement is doing the same job as before, instead of using the NSAutoreleasePool class. The way the NSAutoreleasePool worked was a bit weird, as creating it caused an effect throughout the whole application; @autoreleasepool creates a scoped area and makes it clearer what's within the pool and when it drains (when it goes out of scope). It's also more efficient according to Apple.

- Weak

weak is similar to strong except that it won't increase the reference count by 1. It does not become an owner of that object but just holds a reference to it. If the object's reference count drops to 0, even though you may still be pointing to it here, it will be deallocated from memory.

- release
- autorelease

</details>

Keeps track of the strong references and when this number gets to 0 release the memory
A weak reference is a reference that does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to, and so does not stop ARC from disposing of the referenced instance. This behavior prevents the reference from becoming part of a strong reference cycle. You indicate a weak reference by placing the weak keyword before a property or variable declaration.

Like a weak reference, an unowned reference does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to. Unlike a weak reference, however, an unowned reference is used when the other instance has the same lifetime or a longer lifetime. You indicate an unowned reference by placing the unowned keyword before a property or variable declaration.

```swift
lazy var someClosure: () -> String = {
    [unowned self, weak delegate = self.delegate!] in
    // closure body goes here
}
```

Dependencies
The NSOperation API provides support for dependencies. This is a powerful concept that enables developers to execute tasks in a specific order. An operation is ready when every dependency has finished executing.

Observable
The NSOperation and NSOperationQueue classes have a number of properties that can be observed, using KVO (Key Value Observing). This is another important benefit if you want to monitor the state of an operation or operation queue.

Pause, Cancel, Resume
Operations can be paused, resumed, and cancelled. Once you dispatch a task using Grand Central Dispatch, you no longer have control or insight into the execution of that task. The NSOperation API is more flexible in that respect, giving the developer control over the operation's life cycle.

Control
The NSOperationQueue also adds a number of benefits to the mix. For example, you can specify the maximum number of queued operations that can run simultaneously. This makes it easy to control how many operations run at the same time or to create a serial operation queue.

Grand Central Dispatch is ideal if you just need to dispatch a block of code to a serial or concurrent queue. If you don't want to go through the hassle of creating an NSOperation subclass for a trivial task, then Grand Central Dispatch is a great alternative. Another benefit of Grand Central Dispatch is that you can keep related code together. Take a look at the following example.

<details><summary>Properties</summary>
	
1. Stored properties store constant and variable values as part of an instance(C, S)
 - Instances of a struct with let will not allow change the properties eventhough there are var, which is not true for class
2. Computed properties calculate (rather than store) a value(C, S, E). Instead, they provide a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly.
 - A lazy stored property is a property whose initial value is not calculated until the first time it is used

3. Type properties - properties can also be associated with the type itsel.

```swift
var center: Point {
        get {
            let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
            let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
            return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
        }
        set(newCenter) {
	set {
            origin.x = newCenter.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newCenter.y - (size.height / 2)
        }
    }
```

You must declare computed properties—including read-only computed properties—as variable properties with the var keyword, because their value is not fixed. The let keyword is only used for constant properties, to indicate that their values cannot be changed once they are set as part of instance initialization.

4. Property observers can be added to stored properties you define

```swift 
class StepCounter {
    var totalSteps: Int = 0 {
        willSet(newTotalSteps) {
            print("About to set totalSteps to \(newTotalSteps)")
        }
        didSet {
            if totalSteps > oldValue  {
                print("Added \(totalSteps - oldValue) steps")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
If you pass a property that has observers to a function as an in-out parameter, the willSet and didSet observers are always called. This is because of the copy-in copy-out memory model for in-out parameters: The value is always written back to the property at the end of the function. 
</details>

<details><summary>Initializers</summary>
	Memberwise, Default, Convinience, Designated, Faileable, Required, 
	
	
	Classes and structures must set all of their stored properties to an appropriate initial value by the time an instance of that class or structure is created. Stored properties cannot be left in an indeterminate state.

You can set an initial value for a stored property within an initializer, or by assigning a default property value as part of the property’s definition.

```swift
struct Fahrenheit {
    var temperature: Double
    init() {
        temperature = 32.0
    }
}
var f = Fahrenheit()
print("The default temperature is \(f.temperature)° Fahrenheit")
```

    var temperature = 32.0
}

You can assign a value to a constant property at any point during initialization, as long as it is set to a definite value by the time initialization finishes. Once a constant property is assigned a value, it can’t be further modified.

Swift provides a default initializer for any structure or class that provides default values for all of its properties and does not provide at least one initializer itself. The default initializer simply creates a new instance with all of its properties set to their default values.

Structure types automatically receive a memberwise initializer if they do not define any of their own custom initializers. Unlike a default initializer, the structure receives a memberwise initializer even if it has stored properties that do not have default values.

Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an instance’s initialization. This process, known as initializer delegation, avoids duplicating code across multiple initializers.

Note that if you define a custom initializer for a value type, you will no longer have access to the default initializer (or the memberwise initializer, if it is a structure) for that type.

 --Classes vs Struct initializers

You can initialize the Rect structure below in one of three ways—by using its default zero-initialized origin and size property values, by providing a specific origin point and size, or by providing a specific center point and size. These initialization options are represented by three custom initializers that are part of the Rect structure’s definition

```swift
struct Rect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    init() {}
    init(origin: Point, size: Size) {
        self.origin = origin
        self.size = size
    }
    init(center: Point, size: Size) {
        let originX = center.x - (size.width / 2)
        let originY = center.y - (size.height / 2)
        self.init(origin: Point(x: originX, y: originY), size: size)
    }
}
```

All of a class’s stored properties—including any properties the class inherits from its superclass—must be assigned an initial value during initialization.

Swift defines two kinds of initializers for class types to help ensure all stored properties receive an initial value. These are known as designated initializers and convenience initializers.


Designated initializers are the primary initializers for a class. A designated initializer fully initializes all properties introduced by that class and calls an appropriate superclass initializer to continue the initialization process up the superclass chain.

Classes tend to have very few designated initializers, and it is quite common for a class to have only one. Designated initializers are “funnel” points through which initialization takes place, and through which the initialization process continues up the superclass chain.

Every class must have at least one designated initializer. In some cases, this requirement is satisfied by inheriting one or more designated initializers from a superclass, as described in Automatic Initializer Inheritance below.

Convenience initializers are secondary, supporting initializers for a class. You can define a convenience initializer to call a designated initializer from the same class as the convenience initializer with some of the designated initializer’s parameters set to default values. You can also define a convenience initializer to create an instance of that class for a specific use case or input value type.

You do not have to provide convenience initializers if your class does not require them. Create convenience initializers whenever a shortcut to a common initialization pattern will save time or make initialization of the class clearer in intent.
```swift
 init() {
 }
 
convenience init() {
 }
```

To simplify the relationships between designated and convenience initializers, Swift applies the following three rules for delegation calls between initializers:

Rule 1
A designated initializer must call a designated initializer from its immediate superclass.

Rule 2
A convenience initializer must call another initializer from the same class.

Rule 3
A convenience initializer must ultimately call a designated initializer.

A simple way to remember this is:

Designated initializers must always delegate up.

Convenience initializers must always delegate across.



Two-Phase Initialization
Class initialization in Swift is a two-phase process. In the first phase, each stored property is assigned an initial value by the class that introduced it. Once the initial state for every stored property has been determined, the second phase begins, and each class is given the opportunity to customize its stored properties further before the new instance is considered ready for use.

The use of a two-phase initialization process makes initialization safe, while still giving complete flexibility to each class in a class hierarchy. Two-phase initialization prevents property values from being accessed before they are initialized, and prevents property values from being set to a different value by another initializer unexpectedly.

Swift’s compiler performs four helpful safety-checks to make sure that two-phase initialization is completed without error:

Safety check 1
A designated initializer must ensure that all of the properties introduced by its class are initialized before it delegates up to a superclass initializer.

As mentioned above, the memory for an object is only considered fully initialized once the initial state of all of its stored properties is known. In order for this rule to be satisfied, a designated initializer must make sure that all of its own properties are initialized before it hands off up the chain.

Safety check 2
A designated initializer must delegate up to a superclass initializer before assigning a value to an inherited property. If it doesn’t, the new value the designated initializer assigns will be overwritten by the superclass as part of its own initialization.

Safety check 3
A convenience initializer must delegate to another initializer before assigning a value to any property (including properties defined by the same class). If it doesn’t, the new value the convenience initializer assigns will be overwritten by its own class’s designated initializer.

Safety check 4
An initializer cannot call any instance methods, read the values of any instance properties, or refer to self as a value until after the first phase of initialization is complete.

The class instance is not fully valid until the first phase ends. Properties can only be accessed, and methods can only be called, once the class instance is known to be valid at the end of the first phase.

Here’s how two-phase initialization plays out, based on the four safety checks above:

Phase 1

A designated or convenience initializer is called on a class.

Memory for a new instance of that class is allocated. The memory is not yet initialized.

A designated initializer for that class confirms that all stored properties introduced by that class have a value. The memory for these stored properties is now initialized.

The designated initializer hands off to a superclass initializer to perform the same task for its own stored properties.

This continues up the class inheritance chain until the top of the chain is reached.

Once the top of the chain is reached, and the final class in the chain has ensured that all of its stored properties have a value, the instance’s memory is considered to be fully initialized, and phase 1 is complete.

Phase 2

Working back down from the top of the chain, each designated initializer in the chain has the option to customize the instance further. Initializers are now able to access self and can modify its properties, call its instance methods, and so on.

Finally, any convenience initializers in the chain have the option to customize the instance and to work with self.


Conversely, if you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass convenience initializer, that superclass convenience initializer can never be called directly by your subclass, as per the rules


Automatic Initializer Inheritance
As mentioned above, subclasses do not inherit their superclass initializers by default. However, superclass initializers are automatically inherited if certain conditions are met. In practice, this means that you do not need to write initializer overrides in many common scenarios, and can inherit your superclass initializers with minimal effort whenever it is safe to do so.

Assuming that you provide default values for any new properties you introduce in a subclass, the following two rules apply:

Rule 1
If your subclass doesn’t define any designated initializers, it automatically inherits all of its superclass designated initializers.

Rule 2
If your subclass provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers—either by inheriting them as per rule 1, or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definition—then it automatically inherits all of the superclass convenience initializers.

Failable Initializers
It is sometimes useful to define a class, structure, or enumeration for which initialization can fail. This failure might be triggered by invalid initialization parameter values, the absence of a required external resource, or some other condition that prevents initialization from succeeding.

To cope with initialization conditions that can fail, define one or more failable initializers as part of a class, structure, or enumeration definition. You write a failable initializer by placing a question mark after the init keyword (init?).

<details><summary>Closures</summary>
Global and nested functions, as introduced in Functions, are actually special cases of closures. Closures take one of three forms:

Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values.

Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.

Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.

Swift’s closure expressions have a clean, clear style, with optimizations that encourage brief, clutter-free syntax in common scenarios. These optimizations include:

Inferring parameter and return value types from context

Implicit returns from single-expression closures

Shorthand argument names

Trailing closure syntax

@escaping 
A closure is said to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument to the function, but is called after the function returns. When you declare a function that takes a closure as one of its parameters, you can write @escaping before the parameter’s type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape.
Marking a closure with @escaping means you have to refer to self explicitly within the closure. For example, in the code below, the closure passed to someFunctionWithEscapingClosure(_:) is an escaping closure, which means it needs to refer to self explicitly. In contrast, the closure passed to someFunctionWithNonescapingClosure(_:) is a nonescaping closure, which means it can refer to self implicitly.

@autoclosure
An autoclosure is a closure that is automatically created to wrap an expression that’s being passed as an argument to a function. It doesn’t take any arguments, and when it’s called, it returns the value of the expression that’s wrapped inside of it. This syntactic convenience lets you omit braces around a function’s parameter by writing a normal expression instead of an explicit closure.

Global function is a closure that have a name and does not capture any values
Nested function is a closure that has a name and can capture the value from their enclosed function

(Closure: ()-> void) {}
(Closure:{})
(){}

Functions can be assigned to variables and passed in and out of other functions as argument, just as an int or a string can be
Functions can capture variables that exist outside of their local scope
There are two ways of creating functions - either with the func word , or with {} - closure expression.

Subscripts enable you to query instances of a type by writing one or more values in square brackets after the instance name. Their syntax is similar to both instance method syntax and computed property syntax. You write subscript definitions with the subscript
assert
precondition
autolayout/size classes priorities - hugging/compression resistance
Hugging => content does not want to grow
Compression Resistance => content does not want to shrink
After solving for the required constraints, Auto Layout tries to solve all the optional constraints in priority order from highest to lowest. If it cannot solve for an optional constraint, it tries to come as close as possible to the desired result, and then moves on to the next constraint.

This combination of inequalities, equalities, and priorities gives you a great amount of flexibility and power. By combining multiple constraints, you can define layouts that dynamically adapt as the size and location of the elements in your user interface change.
