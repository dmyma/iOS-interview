<details><summary>Name the framework that is used to construct application’s user interface for iOS. </summary>
The UIKit framework is used to develop application’s user interface for iOS. UIKit framework provides event handling, drawing model, windows, views, and controls specifically designed for a touch screen interface.
</details>
<details><summary>What is the diference between struct and class?</summary>
An  enum  is an object type whose instances represent  distinct  predefined  alternative values. Think of it as a list of known possibilities. An enum is the Swift way to express a set of constants that are alternatives to one another. An enum declaration includes case statements. Each case is the name of one of the alternatives. An instance of an enum will represent exactly one alternative — one case.

Methods A  method  is a function — one that happens to be declared at the top level of an object type declaration. This means that everything said about functions in  Chapter 2 applies. By default, a metho

Properties A  property  is a variable — one that happens to be declared at the top level of an object type declaration. This means that everything said about variables in  Chapter 3 applies. A property has a fixed type; it can be declared with  var  or  let; it can be stored or computed; it can have setter observers. An instance property can also be declared  lazy.

Structs A  struct  is the Swift object type  par excellence. An enum, with its fixed set of cases, is a reduced, specialized kind of object. A class, at the other extreme, will often turn out to be overkill; it has some features that a struct lacks, but if you don’t need those features, a struct may be preferable.

Classes A  class  is similar to a struct, with the following key differences: Reference type Classes are reference types. This means, among other things, that a class instance has two remarkable features that are not true of struct instances or enum instances: Mutability A class instance is mutable in place. Even if your reference to an instance of a class is a constant (let), you can change the value of an instance property through that reference. An instance method of a class never has to be marked  mutating  (and cannot be). Multiple references When a given instance of a class is assigned to multiple variables or passed as argument to a function, you get multiple references to  one and the same object. Inheritance A class can have a superclass. A class that has a superclass is a  subclass  of that superclass. Class types can thus form a hierarchical tree. In Objective-C, classes are the only object type. Some built-in Swift struct types are magically bridged to Objective-C class types, but your custom struct types don’t have that magic. Thus, when programming iOS with Swift, a primary reason for declaring a class, rather than a struct, is as a form of interchange with Objective-C and Cocoa.

Value Types and Reference Types A major difference between enums and structs, on the one hand, and classes, on the other, is that enums and structs are  value types, whereas classes are  reference types. A value type is  not mutable in place, even though it seems to be. For example, consider a struct. A struct is a value type:

<details><summary>App States</summary>
### States

Apps developed for early iOS versions (before iOS 4.0) supported three states: non-running, inactive, and active. An application delegate for pre-iOS 4.0 apps received two important method calls: applicationDidFinishLaunching and applicationWillTerminate. When an app received an applicationDidFinishLaunching message, it was an opportunity for information to be retrieved from the previous launch to restore the app to its last used state. The status, applicationWillTerminate, was used to notify the app when the app was preparing to shut down. This gave the developer an opportunity to save any unsaved data or specific state information.

Currently, there are five possible application states that would be cause for the app to prepare for a transition - such as a shutdown or moving to the background. In certain cases, an app might need to continue processing in the background. However, there is certainly no reason for the app to process any graphics, animations, or display-specific routines. The five states of an iOS app - as listed in the iOS App Programming Guide - include the following:

- Non-running - The app is not running.
- Inactive - The app is running in the foreground, but not receiving events. An iOS app can be placed into an inactive state, for example, when a call or SMS message is received.
- Active - The app is running in the foreground, and receiving events.
- Background - The app is running in the background, and executing code.
- Suspended - The app is in the background, but no code is being executed.
- The seven most important application delegate methods

The operating system calls specific methods within the application delegate to facilitate transitioning to and from various states. The seven most important application delegate methods a developer should handle are:

### application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions
Method called when the launch process is initiated. This is the first opportunity to execute any code within the app.

### application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions
Method called when the launch process is nearly complete. Since this method is called is before any of the app's windows are displayed, it is the last opportunity to prepare the interface and make any final adjustments.

### applicationDidBecomeActive
Once the application has become active, the application delegate will receive a callback notification message via the method applicationDidBecomeActive.

This method is also called each time the app returns to an active state from a previous switch to inactive from a resulting phone call or SMS.

### applicationWillResignActive
There are several conditions that will spawn the applicationWillResignActive method. Each time a temporary event, such as a phone call, happens this method gets called. It is also important to note that "quitting" an iOS app does not terminate the processes, but rather moves the app to the background.

### applicationDidEnterBackground
This method is called when an iOS app is running, but no longer in the foreground. In other words, the user interface is not currently being displayed. According to Apple's UIApplicationDelegate Protocol Reference, the app has approximately five seconds to perform tasks and return. If the method does not return within five seconds, the application is terminated.

### applicationWillEnterForeground
This method is called as an app is preparing to move from the background to the foreground. The app, however, is not moved into an active state without the applicationDidBecomeActive method being called. This method gives a developer the opportunity to re-establish the settings of the previous running state before the app becomes active.

### applicationWillTerminate
This method notifies your application delegate when a termination event has been triggered. Hitting the home button no longer quits the application. Force quitting the iOS app, or shutting down the device triggers the applicationWillTerminate method. This is the opportunity to save the application configuration, settings, and user preferences.

### Application state changes

Every iOS app is always in one of the five app states. The operating system manages the app state, but the app itself is responsible for managing important tasks to ensure smooth transitions between the states. Developers are required to respond appropriately to app state transitions.

With multitasking capability, the latest iOS version manages the resources available to every app. It is important to note, however, that the operating system limits what an app can do in the background. If an app needs to continue running in the background (with limited functionality), you must request permission.

### Launching the app

The moment a user taps the app icon, the app begins to change state. The app delegate receives an application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions method call, and the app state changes from non-running to inactive. Once in the inactive state, the app delegate will receive an application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method call, giving the app an opportunity to make final adjustments before the interface is displayed. If the app has not been designed to launch in the background, the operating system will activate the app, set the app state to active, and send the applicationDidBecomeActive method call to the app delegate.

### Interruptions

On occasion, the iOS app will need to respond to interruptions. An alert-based interruption - such as a phone call - causes the app to move into an inactive state. The app delegate will receive an applicationWillResignActive method call, allowing the app an opportunity to prepare for a temporary inactive state. If the user chooses to ignore the interruption, or the interrupting process has terminated, the app will move back into the active state. While making the transition from inactive to active, the app delegate will receive an applicationDidBecomeActive method call.

### Switching to the background

The iOS devices make it simple to quickly switch from app to app; when a user switches to a different app, the current app moves to the background. The app can be in one of two states: background or suspended. In either case, and before switching to the background, the app delegate receives an applicationWillResignActive method call, followed by an applicationDidEnterBackground message. If in a suspended state, the app sleeps. A background state - meaning that the app is allowed to continue executing code - requires the app to monitor and handle events. Developers need to be aware that the operating system may terminate the app at any time.#

----NSNotificationCenter vs delegate: have not answered in which thread observers receive notification.
----UIView: drawRect: +. setNeedsDisplay -
----Touches: gesture recognizers +. How uiview handles touch events -.
----Patterns: he have worked only with MVC but heared about MVP and VIPER.
Communication: with customer and designer as usual.
 
Suggestions for a candidate (optional)
He needs more experience in team with more than 2 devs and need person who can help him in the beginning in some technologies stack but it depends on project.

<details><summary>NSThread vs NSOperation</summary>
NSThread:

1. iOS developers have to write code for the work/process he want to perform along with for the creation and management of the threads themselves.
2. iOS developers have to be careful about a plan of action for using threads.
3. iOS developer have to manage posiable problems like reuseability of thread, lockings etc. by them self.
4. Thread will consume more memory too.

NSOperation:

1. The NSOperation class is an abstract class which encapsulates the code and data associated with a single task.
2. Developer needs to use subclass or one of the system-defined subclasses of NSOperation to perform the task.
3. Add operations into NSOperationQueue to execute them.
4. The NSOperationQueue creates a new thread for each operation and runs them in the order they are added.
5. Operation queues handle all of the thread management, ensuring that operations are executed as quickly and efficiently as possible.
6. An operation queue executes operations either directly by running them on secondary threads or indirectly using GCD (Grand Central Dispatch).
7. It takes care of all of the memory management and greatly simplifies the process.
8. If you don’t want to use an operation queue, you can also execute an operation by calling its start method. It may make your code too complex.

  NSCoder is an abstractClass which represents a stream of data. They are used in Archiving and Unarchiving objects.

  Do not freeze the app, canceletion, authentication, it's impossible to parse data on the fly</details>
  <details><summary> Explain NSURLSession?</summary>
  The NSURLSession class and related classes provide an API for downloading content via HTTP. This API provides a rich set of delegate methods for supporting authentication and gives your app the ability to perform background downloads when your app is not running or, in iOS, while your app is suspended.

To use the NSURLSession API, your app creates a series of sessions, each of which coordinates a group of related data transfer tasks. For example, if you are writing a web browser, your app might create one session per tab or window. Within each session, your app adds a series of tasks, each of which represents a request for a specific URL (and for any follow-on URLs if the original URL returned an HTTP redirect).

Like most networking APIs, the NSURLSession API is highly asynchronous. If you use the default, system-provided delegate, you must provide a completion handler block that returns data to your app when a transfer finishes successfully or with an error. Alternatively, if you provide your own custom delegate objects, the task objects call those delegates' methods with data as it is received from the server (or, for file downloads, when the transfer is complete).

Note: Completion callbacks are primarily intended as an alternative to using a custom delegate. If you create a task using a method that takes a completion callback, the delegate methods for response and data delivery are not called.
The NSURLSession API provides status and progress properties, in addition to delivering this information to delegates. It supports canceling, restarting (resuming), and suspending tasks, and it provides the ability to resume suspended, canceled, or failed downloads where they left off.</details>
  <details> 
  <summary> Explain types of NSURLSession?</summary>
  The NSURLSession API supports three types of sessions, as determined by the type of configuration object used to create the session:

- Default sessions : behave similarly to other Foundation methods for downloading URLs. They use a persistent disk-based cache and store credentials in the user's keychain.

- Ephemeral sessions : do not store any data to disk; all caches, credential stores, and so on are kept in RAM and tied to the session. Thus, when your app invalidates the session, they are purged automatically.

- Background sessions : are similar to default sessions, except that a separate process handles all data transfers. Background sessions have some additional limitations.
</details>
  
  <details> 
  <summary> Explain life cycle of URL Session?</summary>
  You can use the NSURLSession API in two ways: with a system-provided delegate or with your own delegate. In general, you must use your own delegate if your app does any of the following:

- Uses background sessions to download or upload content while your app is not running.
- Performs custom authentication.
- Performs custom SSL certificate verification.
- Decides whether a transfer should be downloaded to disk or displayed based on the MIME type returned by the server or other similar criteria.
- Uploads data from a body stream (as opposed to an NSData object).
- Limits caching programmatically.
- Limits HTTP redirects programmatically.

If your app does not need to do any of these things, your app can use the system-provided delegates. Depending on which technique you choose, you should read one of the following sections:

- Life Cycle of a URL Session with System-Provided Delegates : provides a lightweight view of how your code creates and uses a URL session. You should read this section even if you intend to write your own delegate, because it gives you a complete picture of what your code must do to configure the object and use it.

- Life Cycle of a URL Session with Custom Delegates : provides a complete view of every step in the operation of a URL session. You should refer to this section to help you understand how the session interacts with its delegate. In particular, this explains when each of the delegate methods is called.

<details> 
  <summary>core data and different threads</summary>

Basic rules are:

Use one NSPersistentStoreCoordinator per program not per thread.
Create one NSManagedObjectContext per thread.
Never pass an NSManagedObject on a thread to the other thread.
Instead, get the object IDs via -objectID and pass it to the other thread.
More rules:

Make sure you save the object into the store before getting the object ID. Until saved, they're temporary, and you can't access them from another thread.
And beware of the merge policies if you make changes to the managed objects from more than one thread.
NSManagedObjectContext's -mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification: is helpful.

</details>
<details> 
  <summary> What steps should be accomplish in order to save/fetch an object?  </summary>
Step 1  —  Describes which entity we are working with. LEts say Person.
Step 2  —  Create the our Class(PErson) NSManagedObject. The NSManagedObject will be inserted into our managed object context later when saving.
Step 3  —  Now that we have specified our entity and created a new class(person), we need to save the person’s name. In this case, we use key value coding to set the value for our key, which is specified as “name”.
Step 4  —  At this point, it’s time to save our managedObjectContext, which persists the data to the store. If an error should occur, we catch it at this point.
- Fetch
Step 1  —  Create a fetch request. A fetch request is what we use to fetch data from our Core Data store. A fetch request can be customizable to include only the results or attributes that you need. In our case, we want to fetch all objects from the Person entity.
Step 2  —  We now try to fetch data from our Core Data store and store it in our managed object context, whose job it is to create a scratchpad of sorts when dealing with managed objects.
Step 3  —  We have a simple for loop that loops through each result in our fetched items array. At this point, we print out the name of each saved object into the console.

How do access coredata?
NSManagedObjectContext

How do I you get contex?
NSPersistentContainer
(UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer

let container = (UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate).persistentContainer let context: NSManagedObjectContext = container.viewContext

Every NSManagedObject knows the managedObjectContext it is in.

How do you access entities?
let context = AppDelegate.viewContext
  if let tweet = Tweet(context: context) {
tweet.text = “140 characters of pure joy”
tweet.created = Date() as NSDate
     let joe = TwitterUser(context: tweet.managedObjectContext)
     tweet.tweeter = joe
tweet.tweeter.name = “Joe Schmo” }

-Thread safety?
NSManagedObjectContext is not thread safe
Luckily, Core Data access is usually very fast, so multithreading is only rarely needed.
NSManagedObjectContexts are created using a queue-based concurrency model.
This means that you can only touch a context and its NSMO’s in the queue it was created on. Often we use only the main queue and its AppDelegate.viewContext, so it’s not an issue.
Thread-Safe Access to an NSManagedObjectContext context.performBlock { // or performBlockAndWait until it finishes
// do stuff with context (this will happen in its safe Q (the Q it was created on)) }
Note that the Q might well be the main Q, so you’re not necessarily getting “multithreaded.” It’s generally a good idea to wrap all your Core Data code using this.
Although if you have no multithreaded code at all in your app, you can probably skip it.
It won’t cost anything if it’s not in a multithreaded situation.

Convenient way to do database stuff in the background
The persistentContainer has a simple method for doing database stuff in the background AppDelegate.persistentContainer.performBackgroundTask { context in
// do some CoreData stuff using the passed-in context
// this closure is not the main queue, so don’t do UI stuff here (dispatch back if needed) // and don’t use AppDelegate.viewContext here, use the passed context
// you don’t have to use NSManagedObjectContext’s perform method here either
// since you’re implicitly doing this block on that passed context’s thread
try? context.save() // don’t forget this (and catch errors if needed)
}
This would generally only be needed if you’re doing a big update.
You’d want to see that some Core Data update is a performance problem in Instruments first. For small queries and small updates, doing it on the main queue is fine.

<details><summary>Patterns</summary>

Abstract Factory
-Builder vs Composite vs Factory

-Builder focuses on constructing a complex object step by step. Abstract Factory emphasizes a family of product objects (either simple or complex). Builder returns the product as a final step, but as far as the Abstract Factory is concerned, the product gets returned immediately.
-Builder often builds a Composite.
-Often, designs start out using Factory Method (less complicated, more customizable, subclasses proliferate) and evolve toward Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder (more flexible, more complex) as the designer discovers where more flexibility is needed.

-Builder and Abstract Factory
-The Builder design pattern is very similar, at some extent, to the Abstract Factory pattern. That's why it is important to be able to make the difference between the situations when one or the other is used. In the case of the Abstract Factory, the client uses the factory's methods to create its own objects. In the Builder's case, the Builder class is instructed on how to create the object and then it is asked for it, but the way that the class is put together is up to the Builder class, this detail making the difference between the two patterns.
Common interface for products
-In practice the products created by the concrete builders have a structure significantly different, so if there is not a reason to derive different products a common parent class. This also distinguishes the Builder pattern from the Abstract Factory pattern which creates objects derived from a common type.
Factory: Consider a restaurant. The creation of "today's meal" is a factory pattern, because you tell the kitchen "get me today's meal" and the kitchen (factory) decides what object to generate, based on hidden criteria.
-Builder: The builder appears if you order a custom pizza. In this case, the waiter tells the chef (builder) "I need a pizza; add cheese, onions and bacon to it!" Thus, the builder exposes the attributes the generated object should have, but hides how to set them.

Singleton 
-how to implement logging facility using the Singleton pattern
-you are not allways uses singelton and it is expensive to inialize how can you improve it?

Observer
what strategy to efficiently update its observer?
Observer updates to often, instead update multiply properties one by one, it is better to turn off observer and then run single update notifications to all interested objexts
-another, O determines what have changed, it is better update the part of the information that chaged on the screen then redraw all screen, so O needs to know what part of the model has changed

Other objects subscribe to be immediately notified of any changes.

### Example

```swift

protocol PropertyObserver : class {
    func willChange(propertyName: String, newPropertyValue: Any?)
    func didChange(propertyName: String, oldPropertyValue: Any?)
}

final class TestChambers {

    weak var observer:PropertyObserver?

    private let testChamberNumberName = "testChamberNumber"

    var testChamberNumber: Int = 0 {
        willSet(newValue) {
            observer?.willChange(propertyName: testChamberNumberName, newPropertyValue: newValue)
        }
        didSet {
            observer?.didChange(propertyName: testChamberNumberName, oldPropertyValue: oldValue)
        }
    }
}

final class Observer : PropertyObserver {
    func willChange(propertyName: String, newPropertyValue: Any?) {
        if newPropertyValue as? Int == 1 {
            print("Okay. Look. We both said a lot of things that you're going to regret.")
        }
    }

    func didChange(propertyName: String, oldPropertyValue: Any?) {
        if oldPropertyValue as? Int == 0 {
            print("Sorry about the mess. I've really let the place go since you killed me.")
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift

var observerInstance = Observer()
var testChambers = TestChambers()
testChambers.observer = observerInstance
testChambers.testChamberNumber += 1
```

Creational
==========

> In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

import Swift
import Foundation
```

🌰 Abstract Factory
-------------------

The abstract factory pattern is used to provide a client with a set of related or dependant objects. 
The "family" of objects created by the factory are determined at run-time.

### Example
 
Protocols

```swift

protocol 

imal {
    func stringValue() -> String
    // factory
    static func make(string : String) -> Decimal
}

typealias NumberFactory = (String) -> Decimal

// Number implementations with factory methods

struct NextStepNumber: Decimal {
    private var nextStepNumber: NSNumber

    func stringValue() -> String { return nextStepNumber.stringValue }
    
    // factory
    static func make(string: String) -> Decimal {
        return NextStepNumber(nextStepNumber: NSNumber(value: (string as NSString).longLongValue))
    }
}

struct SwiftNumber : Decimal {
    private var swiftInt: Int

    func stringValue() -> String { return "\(swiftInt)" }
    
    // factory
    static func make(string: String) -> Decimal {
        return SwiftNumber(swiftInt:(string as NSString).integerValue)
    }
}
```

Abstract factory

```swift

enum NumberType {
    case nextStep, swift
}

enum NumberHelper {
    static func factory(for type: NumberType) -> NumberFactory {
        switch type {
        case .nextStep:
            return NextStepNumber.make
        case .swift:
            return SwiftNumber.make
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

```swift

let factoryOne = NumberHelper.factory(for: .nextStep)
let numberOne = factoryOne("1")
numberOne.stringValue()

let factoryTwo = NumberHelper.factory(for: .swift)
let numberTwo = factoryTwo("2")
numberTwo.stringValue()
```

💍 Singleton
------------

The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.
All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.
There are very few applications, do not overuse this pattern!

### Example:

```swift

class DeathStarSuperlaser {
    static let sharedInstance = DeathStarSuperlaser()

    private init() {
        // Private initialization to ensure just one instance is created.
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```swift

let laser = DeathStarSuperlaser.sharedInstance

```

🍧 Decorator
------------

The decorator pattern is used to extend or alter the functionality of objects at run- time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class. 
This provides a flexible alternative to using inheritance to modify behaviour.

### Example

```swift

protocol Coffee {
    func getCost() -> Double
    func getIngredients() -> String
}

class SimpleCoffee: Coffee {
    func getCost() -> Double {
        return 1.0
    }

    func getIngredients() -> String {
        return "Coffee"
    }
}

class CoffeeDecorator: Coffee {
    private let decoratedCoffee: Coffee
    fileprivate let ingredientSeparator: String = ", "

    required init(decoratedCoffee: Coffee) {
        self.decoratedCoffee = decoratedCoffee
    }

    func getCost() -> Double {
        return decoratedCoffee.getCost()
    }

    func getIngredients() -> String {
        return decoratedCoffee.getIngredients()
    }
}

final class Milk: CoffeeDecorator {
    required init(decoratedCoffee: Coffee) {
        super.init(decoratedCoffee: decoratedCoffee)
    }

    override func getCost() -> Double {
        return super.getCost() + 0.5
    }

    override func getIngredients() -> String {
        return super.getIngredients() + ingredientSeparator + "Milk"
    }
}

final class WhipCoffee: CoffeeDecorator {
    required init(decoratedCoffee: Coffee) {
        super.init(decoratedCoffee: decoratedCoffee)
    }

    override func getCost() -> Double {
        return super.getCost() + 0.7
    }

    override func getIngredients() -> String {
        return super.getIngredients() + ingredientSeparator + "Whip"
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```swift

var someCoffee: Coffee = SimpleCoffee()
print("Cost : \(someCoffee.getCost()); Ingredients: \(someCoffee.getIngredients())")
someCoffee = Milk(decoratedCoffee: someCoffee)
print("Cost : \(someCoffee.getCost()); Ingredients: \(someCoffee.getIngredients())")
someCoffee = WhipCoffee(decoratedCoffee: someCoffee)
print("Cost : \(someCoffee.getCost()); Ingredients: \(someCoffee.getIngredients())")
```

🎁 Façade
---------

The facade pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.
(REST api)

### Example

```swift

enum Eternal {

    static func set(_ object: Any, forKey defaultName: String) {
        let defaults: UserDefaults = UserDefaults.standard
        defaults.set(object, forKey:defaultName)
        defaults.synchronize()
    }

    static func object(forKey key: String) -> AnyObject! {
        let defaults: UserDefaults = UserDefaults.standard
        return defaults.object(forKey: key) as AnyObject!
    }

}
```

### Usage

```swift

Eternal.set("Disconnect me. I’d rather be nothing", forKey:"Bishop")
Eternal.object(forKey: "Bishop")
```

In defintion terms:

Swift optional variable is an enum, which can have nil as a value, where as objective variable is a pointer, where nil represents, it is pointing no where.

In Usage terms:

Both are somewhat similar in the sense,

that both variables having nil value on messaging any method returns nil

Optional chaining in Swift is similar to messaging nil in Objective-C, but in a way that works for any type, and that can be checked for success or failure.
But in Safety Checking, Swift optional is the winner

As compiler does many type checking for you already, Ex. non optional parameter can't accept optional, thus you will need to unwrap it by first checking it for nil Or when you you cast any variable, it always returns an optional, thus again a safety feature at compiler level</details>

  <summary> What are the levels of privacy in swift 3?</summary>



Swift 3 has five levels of privacy: internal The default rule is that declarations are  internal, meaning that they are globally visible to  all code in all  files  within the containing module.  That is why Swift files within the same module can see one another’s top-level contents  automatically, with no effort on your part. (That’s different from C and Objective-C, where files can’t see each other at all unless you explicitly show them to one another through include  or  import  statements.) fileprivate  (narrower than  internal) A thing declared  fileprivate  is visible  only within its containing  file.  For example, two object types declared in the same file can see one another’s members declared  fileprivate, but code in other files cannot see those members. private  (even narrower than  fileprivate) A thing declared  private  is visible  only within its containing curly braces. In effect, the visibility of an object type’s member declared  private  is limited to code within this class declaration. (A  private  declaration at the top level of a file is equivalent to  fileprivate.) public  (wider than  internal) A thing declared  public  is visible  even outside its containing module.  Another module must first import this module before it can see anything at all. But once another module  has  imported this module, it still won’t be able to see anything in this module that hasn’t been explicitly declared public. If you don’t write any modules, you might never need to declare anything public. If you do write a module, you  must  declare  something  public, or your module is useless. open  (even wider than  public) If a class is declared  open, code in another module can subclass it; it can’t do that if the class is declared merely  public. If an open class member is declared  open, code in another module that subclasses this class can override

<details><summary>When init method needed?</summary>
init method are not so common because properties can have their defaults set using =
or properties can be optionals
you can use lazy
So you only need init when a value can’t be set in any of these ways</details>

<details> 
  <summary>More</summary>
Delegation Delegation  is an object-oriented design pattern, a relationship between two objects, in which a primary object’s behavior is customized or assisted by a secondary object. The secondary object is the primary object’s  delegate.  No subclassing is involved, and indeed the primary object is agnostic about the delegate’s class.

Notifications Cocoa provides your app with a single NotificationCenter instance (Objective-C NSNotificationCenter), informally called the  notification  center.  This instance, available as  NotificationCenter.default, is the basis of a mechanism for sending messages called  notifications. A notification is a Notification instance (Objective-C NSNotification). The idea is that any object can be registered with the notification center to receive certain notifications. Another object can hand the notification center a notification to send out (this is called  posting  the notification). The notification center will then send that notification to all objects that are registered to receive it.

Data Sources A  data source  is like a delegate, except that its methods supply the data for another object to display. The chief Cocoa classes with data sources are UITableView, UICollectionView, UIPickerView, and UIPageViewController. In each case, the data source must formally adopt a data source protocol with required methods.

Key–Value Observing Key–value observing, or  KVO, is a notification mechanism that doesn’t use the NotificationCenter. It allows one object to be registered  directly with a second object  so as to be notified when a value in the second object changes. Moreover, the second object — the observed object — doesn’t actually have to  do  anything; it needn’t even be conscious of the fact that this registration has taken place. When the value in the observed object changes, the registered object — the observer — is automatically notified. (Perhaps a better architectural analogy would be with the target–action mechanism; this is a target–action mechanism that works between  any  two objects.)

Memory Management of Protocol-Typed References Only a reference to an instance of a class type can be declared  weak  or  unowned. A reference to an instance of a struct or enum type cannot be so declared, because its memory management doesn’t work the same way (and is not subject to retain cycles). A reference that is declared as a protocol type, therefore, has a problem. A protocol might be adopted by a struct or an enum. Therefore you cannot wantonly declare such a reference  weak  or  unowned. You can only declare a protocol-typed reference weak  or  unowned  if it is a class protocol — that is, if it is marked with  @objc  or  class. In this code, SecondViewControllerDelegate is a protocol that I’ve declared. This code won’t compile unless SecondViewControllerDelegate is declared as a class protocol: class SecondViewController : UIViewController {     weak var delegate : SecondViewControllerDelegate?     // ... } Here’s the actual declaration of SecondViewControllerDelegate; it  is  declared as a class protocol, and that’s why the preceding code is legal: protocol SecondViewControllerDelegate : class {     func accept(data:Any!) } A protocol declared in Objective-C is implicitly marked as  @objc  and is a class protocol. Thus, this declaration from my real-life code is legal: weak var delegate : WKScriptMessageHandler? WKScriptMessageHandler is a protocol declared by Cocoa (in particular, by the Web Kit framework). Thus, it is implicitly marked  @objc; only a class can adopt WKScriptMessageHandler, and so the compiler is satisfied that the  delegate  variable will be an instance of a class, and thus the reference can be treated as  weak.

NSMeasurement and Friends New in iOS 10, the Measurement type (Objective-C NSMeasurement) embodies the notion of a measurement by some unit (Unit, Objective-C NSUnit). A unit may be along some dimension that may be expressible in different units convertible to one another; by reducing values in different units of the same dimension to a base unit, a Measurement permits you to perform arithmetic operations and conversions. The dimensions, which are all subclasses of the (abstract) Dimension class (Objective-C NSDimension, an NSUnit subclass), have names like UnitAngle and UnitLength (Objective-C NSUnitAngle, NSUnitLength), and have class properties vending an instance corresponding to a particular unit type; for example, UnitAngle has class properties  degrees  and  radians  and others, and UnitLength has class properties  miles  and  kilometers  and others. To illustrate, I’ll add 5 miles to

The Secret Life of NSObject Because every Objective-C class inherits from NSObject, it’s worth taking some time to explore NSObject. NSObject is constructed in a rather elaborate way: • It defines some native class methods and instance methods having mostly to do with the basics of instantiation and of method sending and resolution. • It adopts the NSObject protocol. This protocol declares instance methods having mostly to do with memory management, the relationship between an instance and its class, and introspection. Because all the NSObject protocol methods are required, the NSObject class implements them all. In Swift, the NSObject protocol is called NSObjectProtocol, to avoid name clash. • It implements convenience methods related to the NSCopying, NSMutableCopying, and NSCoding protocols, without formally adopting those protocols. NSObject intentionally doesn’t adopt these protocols because this would cause all other classes to adopt them, which would be wrong. But thanks to this architecture, if a class  does  adopt one of these protocols, you can call the corresponding convenience method. For example, NSObject implements the  copy  instance method, so you can call  copy  on any instance, but you’ll crash unless the instance’s class also adopts the NSCopying protocol and implements  copy(with:). • A large number of methods are injected into NSObject by more than two dozen categories on NSObject, scattered among various header files. For example, awakeFromNib  (see  Chapter 7) comes from the UINibLoadingAdditions category on NSObject, declared in  UINibLoading.h. • A class object is an object. Therefore all Objective-C classes, which are objects of type Class, inherit from NSObject. Therefore,  any instance method of NSObject can be called on a class object as a class method!  For example,  responds(to:)  is defined as an instance method by the NSObject protocol, but it can (therefore) be treated also as a class method and sent to a class object.

Creation, destruction, and memory management Methods for creating an instance, such as  alloc  and  copy, along with methods for learning when something is happening in the lifetime of an object, such as initialize  and  dealloc, plus methods that manage memory. Class relationships Methods for learning an object’s class and inheritance, such as  superclass, isKind(of:), and  isMember(of:). Object introspection and comparison Methods for asking what would happen if an object were sent a certain message, such as  responds(to:), for representing an object as a string (description), and for comparing objects (isEqual(_:)). Message response Methods for meddling with what does happen when an object is sent a certain message, such as  doesNotRecognizeSelector(_:). If you’re curious, see the Objective-C Runtime Programming Guide. Message sending Methods for sending a message dynamically. For example,  perform(_:)  takes a selector as parameter, and sending it to an object tells that object to perform that selector. This might seem identical to just sending that message to that object, but what if you don’t know what message to send until runtime? Moreover, variants on  perform  allow you to send a message on a specified thread, or send a message after a certain amount of time has passed (perform(_:with:afterDelay:)  and similar).







An  enum  is an object type whose instances represent  distinct  predefined  alternative values. Think of it as a list of known possibilities. An enum is the Swift way to express a set of constants that are alternatives to one another. An enum declaration includes case statements. Each case is the name of one of the alternatives. An instance of an enum will represent exactly one alternative — one case.

Methods A  method  is a function — one that happens to be declared at the top level of an object type declaration. This means that everything said about functions in  Chapter 2 applies. By default, a metho

Properties A  property  is a variable — one that happens to be declared at the top level of an object type declaration. This means that everything said about variables in  Chapter 3 applies. A property has a fixed type; it can be declared with  var  or  let; it can be stored or computed; it can have setter observers. An instance property can also be declared  lazy.

Structs A  struct  is the Swift object type  par excellence. An enum, with its fixed set of cases, is a reduced, specialized kind of object. A class, at the other extreme, will often turn out to be overkill; it has some features that a struct lacks, but if you don’t need those features, a struct may be preferable.

Classes A  class  is similar to a struct, with the following key differences: Reference type Classes are reference types. This means, among other things, that a class instance has two remarkable features that are not true of struct instances or enum instances: Mutability A class instance is mutable in place. Even if your reference to an instance of a class is a constant (let), you can change the value of an instance property through that reference. An instance method of a class never has to be marked  mutating  (and cannot be). Multiple references When a given instance of a class is assigned to multiple variables or passed as argument to a function, you get multiple references to  one and the same object. Inheritance A class can have a superclass. A class that has a superclass is a  subclass  of that superclass. Class types can thus form a hierarchical tree. In Objective-C, classes are the only object type. Some built-in Swift struct types are magically bridged to Objective-C class types, but your custom struct types don’t have that magic. Thus, when programming iOS with Swift, a primary reason for declaring a class, rather than a struct, is as a form of interchange with Objective-C and Cocoa.

Value Types and Reference Types A major difference between enums and structs, on the one hand, and classes, on the other, is that enums and structs are  value types, whereas classes are  reference types. A value type is  not mutable in place, even though it seems to be. For example, consider a struct. A struct is a value type:






Functions are Reference Types The  countAdded  and  greet  example, earlier (“Closure Preserving Its Captured Environment”  on page  59), demonstrates that functions are reference types. To show what I mean, I’ll start with a contrasting situation. Two  separate  calls to a function factory method produce two  different  functions, as you would expect: let countedGreet = countAdder(greet) let countedGreet2 = countAdder(greet) countedGreet() // count is 1 countedGreet2() // count is 1 The two functions  countedGreet  and  countedGreet2, in that code, are maintaining their counts separately. But simple assignment or parameter passing results in a new reference to the  same  function, maintaining the  same  count: let countedGreet = countAdder(greet) let countedGreet2 = countedGreet countedGreet() // count is 1 countedGreet2() // count is 2

Class Properties and Methods A subclass can override its inherited properties. The override must have the same name and type as the inherited property, and must be marked with  override. (A property cannot have the same name as an inherited property but a different type, as there is no way to distinguish them.) The chief restriction here is that an  override  property  cannot be a stored property. More specifically: • If the superclass property is writable (a stored property or a computed property with a setter), the subclass’s override may consist of adding setter observers to this property. • Alternatively, the subclass’s override may be a computed property. In that case: ■ If the superclass property is stored, the subclass’s computed property override must have both a getter and a setter. ■ If the superclass property is computed, the subclass’s computed property override must reimplement all the accessors that the superclass implements. If the

Polymorphism When a computer language has a hierarchy of types and subtypes, it must resolve the question of what such a hierarchy means for the relationship between the type of an object  and the declared type of a  reference  to that object. Swift obeys the principles of polymorphism. In my view, it is polymorphism that turns an object-based language into a full-fledged object-oriented language. We may summarize Swift’s polymorphism principles as follows:

Casting The Swift compiler, with its strict typing, imposes severe restrictions on what messages can be sent to an object reference. The messages that the compiler will permit to be sent to an object reference depend upon the reference’s  declared  type. But the internal identity principle of polymorphism says that, under the hood, an object may have a  real  type that is different from its reference’s declared type. Such an object may be capable of receiving messages that the compiler won’t permit us to send.

Type Reference It can be useful for an instance to refer to its own type — for example, to send a message to that type. In an earlier example, a Dog instance method fetched a Dog class property by sending a message to the Dog type explicitly — by using the word  Dog:

Protocols A  protocol  is a way of expressing commonalities between otherwise unrelated types. For example, a Bee object and a Bird object might need to have certain features in common by virtue of the fact that both a bee and a bird can fly. Thus, it might be useful to define a Flier type. The question is: In what sense can both Bee and Bird be Fliers? One possibility, of course, is class inheritance. If Bee and Bird are both classes, there’s a class hierarchy of superclasses and subclasses. So Flier could be the superclass of both Bee and Bird. The problem is that there may be other reasons why Flier  can’t  be the superclass of both Bee and Bird. A Bee is an Insect; a Bird isn’t. Yet they both have the power of flight — independently. We need a type that cuts across the class hierarchy somehow, tying remote classes together. Moreover, what if Bee and Bird are  not  both classes? In Swift, that’s a very real possibility. Important and powerful objects can be structs instead of classes. But there is no struct hierarchy of superstructs and substructs! That, after all, is one of the major differences between structs and classes. Yet structs need the ability to possess and express formal commonalities every bit as much as classes do. How can a Bee struct and a Bird struct both be Fliers?

Generics A  generic  is a sort of placeholder for a type, into which an actual type will be slotted later. This is useful because of Swift’s strict typing. Without sacrificing that strict typing, there are situations where you can’t or don’t want to specify too precisely in a certain region of your code what the exact type of something is going to be.

Type Constraints All our examples so far have permitted any type to be substituted for the placeholder. Alternatively, you can limit the types that are eligible to be used for resolving a particular placeholder. This is called a  type constraint. The simplest form of type constraint is to put a colon and a type name after the placeholder’s name when it first appears. The type name after the colon can be a class name or a protocol name. For example, let’s return to our Flier and its  flockTogetherWith  function. Sup

Extensions An  extension  is a way of injecting your own code into an object type that has already been declared elsewhere; you are  extending  an existing object type. You can extend your own object types; you can also extend one of Swift’s object types or one of Cocoa’s object types, in which case you are  adding functionality  to a type that doesn’t belong to you!

	new InputStremReader(con,getInputStream()));
String line = “”;
while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
sb.append(line + “/n”);
}
reader.close();

It's important to remember that closures are reference types in Swift and can cause retain cycles just as easily, if not more easily, as classes. In order for a closure to execute later, it needs to retain any variables that it needs for it to run. Similarly to classes, a closure captures references as strong by default. 
In this case, the SomeObject class has a strong reference to aClosure and aClosure has captured self (the SomeObject instance) strongly as well. This is why Swift always makes you add self. explicitly while in a closure to help prevent programmers from accidentally capturing self without realizing it, and therefore most likely causing a retain cycle.
To have a closure capture variables as weak or unowned, you can give the closure instructions on how to capture certain variables.

  <summary>DispatchGroup vs. OperationQueue in Swift</summary>
You probably found yourself in a situation where you had to do a bunch of asynchronous tasks and you just wanted to get notified when all of them finish.
 If you’re working on a project that’s not using Operations and you don’t want to refactor any of the existing code, DispatchGroups is probably the easiest way for you to know when a bunch of asynchronous calls is finished. What’s really important here is the enter-leave pairs. You have to be very careful and make sure that you leave the group. It would be easy to introduce a bug in the code above. Let’s say that we didn’t leave the group in that guard statement above, just before the return. If the API called failed, or the JSON was malformed, the number of group entries would not match the number of leaves. So the group completion handler would never get called. If you’re calling this method from the UI and displaying an activity indicator while your networking requests are running, you would never get a callback from the method, and you would keep on spinning
 Operation queues are great and all, but if you just want to know when your queue is finished you won’t find a ready-made API waiting for you. This is actually totally fine, because, operation queue is designed around a different concept, but let’s not get side tracked.There is a simple trick you can use to get notified when your async tasks are finished. The trick is to use dependencies. You have two options here. If you need your operations to execute one after another, you can set the next operation to be dependent on the previous. So when your last operation is finished, your queue is finished as well. This is easy to do. But what if you have a bunch of concurrent operations? You want to execute as many of them as possible at the same time and you want to get notified when all of them finish? Well, just create another operation. Operations can have dependencies on multiple operations. So when you create your operations you add them as a dependency to that operation. When all dependent operation finish, your operation will get executed. And this way you can tell that your ‘queue’ is finished. If you think about this from a logical perspective, it makes perfect sense. Anyone can add a bunch of operations in the operation queue, and if you don’t own it completely, you don’t know who added what. So having a callback that will tell you that the queue is empty would not be very useful. Dependencies are baked into the Operations, so why not use them
 Operations are great, but unless your project is already using them, you’ll probably wanna go with DispatchGroup. You can also implement this into your existing codebase practically without any refactoring. Both of these approaches are just fine and they do what it says on the tin. But at the end of the day, it will be up to you and your project.

  <summary>Operation and OperationQueue(FIFO)</summary>
OperationQueue is a great tool to use if you have complex logic in your app and if you have to manage dependencies between the operations. It’s very elegant at that. Passing data between operations is a bit messy. When your operation is finished you store the data in an instance variable which you read from the dependent operation. That’s not very elegant at all. There are much neater solutions out there like, for example, PromiseKit.
Operation is an abstract class and represents a logical unit of work. For example, in your code you probably have a method that fetches data from the API. If you want to use OperationQueue you would have to create your class that subclasses Operation and move that method in your new class. Doing this has an added benefit of forcing you to use the single responsibility principle. Once you have your class you add it to your OperationQueue and wait for it to finish executing. If you just want to execute a small piece of code or call a method you can use BlockOperation and NSInvocationOperation instead of subclassing Operation. You can set the priority of your operations by setting your queuePriority property of the operation. You can also control how much of the system resources will be given to your operation by setting qualityOfService property. OperationQueue can execute multiple operations at the same time. You can set the number of maxConcurrentOperationCount or you can let the system set this property to the default value which is different for each device. A beautiful thing about operations is that they can be cancelled which is something you can’t do with blocks. Let’s say you have three operations: networking call, parsing of data and saving in the database. If your networking call fails, there’s little sense in executing the remaining two operations so you can simply cancel them. GCD stands for Grand Central Dispatch. You might think that with OperationQueues and Operations there’s no need for GCD but they actually work together. Fun fact: Operations are built on top of GCD.

  <summary>Regular notification centers</summary> deliver notifications on the thread in which the notification was posted. Distributed notification centers deliver notifications on the main thread. At times, you may require notifications to be delivered on a particular thread that is determined by you instead of the notification center. For example, if an object running in a background thread is listening for notifications from the user interface, such as a window closing, you would like to receive the notifications in the background thread instead of the main thread. In these cases, you must capture the notifications as they are delivered on the default thread and redirect them to the appropriate thread.

One way to redirect notifications is to use a custom notification queue (not an NSNotificationQueue object) to hold any notifications that are received on incorrect threads and then process them on the correct thread. This technique works as follows. You register for a notification normally. When a notification arrives, you test whether the current thread is the thread that should handle the notification. If it is the wrong thread, you store the notification in a queue and then send a signal to the correct thread, indicating that a notification needs processing. The other thread receives the signal, removes the notification from the queue, and processes the notification.

To implement this technique, your observer object needs to have instance variables for the following values: a mutable array to hold the notifications, a communication port for signaling the correct thread (a Mach port), a lock to prevent multithreading conflicts with the notification array, and a value that identifies the correct thread (an NSThread object). You also need methods to setup the variables, to process the notifications, and to receive the Mach messages. Here are the necessary definitions to add to the class of your observer object.</details>

	Task: a simple, single piece of work that needs to be done.

Thread: a mechanism provided by the operating system that allows multiple sets of instructions to operate at the same time within a single application.

Process: an executable chunk of code, which can be made up of multiple threads.

GCD is a lightweight way to represent units of work that are going to be executed concurrently. You don’t schedule these units of work; the system takes care of scheduling for you. Adding dependency among blocks can be a headache. Canceling or suspending a block creates extra work for you as a developer! :]

NSOperation adds a little extra overhead compared to GCD, but you can add dependency among various operations and re-use, cancel or suspend them.

	ref vs value

	Classes and structures in Swift have many things in common. Both can:

Define properties to store values

Define methods to provide functionality

Define subscripts to provide access to their values using subscript syntax

Define initializers to set up their initial state

Be extended to expand their functionality beyond a default implementation

Conform to protocols to provide standard functionality of a certain kind

For more information, see Properties, Methods, Subscripts, Initialization, Extensions, and Protocols.

Classes have additional capabilities that structures do not:

Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.

Type casting enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime.

Deinitializers enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned.

Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.

For more information, see Inheritance, Type Casting, Deinitialization, and Automatic Reference Counting.

As a general guideline, consider creating a structure when one or more of these conditions apply:

The structure’s primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values.

It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be copied rather than referenced when you assign or pass around an instance of that structure.

Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types, which would also be expected to be copied rather than referenced.

The structure does not need to inherit properties or behavior from another existing type.

Examples of good candidates for structures include:

The size of a geometric shape, perhaps encapsulating a width property and a height property, both of type Double.

A way to refer to ranges within a series, perhaps encapsulating a start property and a length property, both of type Int.

A point in a 3D coordinate system, perhaps encapsulating x, y and z properties, each of type Double.

Extensions can add a new continuance initializer but can not add a new designated Initializer or deinit.

- Nonatomic

nonatomic is used for multi threading purposes. If we have set the nonatomic attribute at the time of declaration, then any other thread wanting access to that object can access it and give results in respect to multi-threading.

- Copy

copy is required when the object is mutable. Use this if you need the value of the object as it is at this moment, and you don't want that value to reflect any changes made by other owners of the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it because you are retaining the copy.

- Assign

Assign is somewhat the opposite to copy. When calling the getter of an assign property, it returns a reference to the actual data. Typically you use this attribute when you have a property of primitive type (float, int, BOOL...)

- Retain

retain is required when the attribute is a pointer to an object. The setter generated by @synthesize will retain (aka add a retain count to) the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it. By using retain it will increase the retain count and occupy memory in autorelease pool.

- Strong

strong is a replacement for the retain attribute, as part of Objective-C Automated Reference Counting (ARC). In non-ARC code it's just a synonym for retain.

- what is Auto release pool?
The @autoreleasepool statement is doing the same job as before, instead of using the NSAutoreleasePool class. The way the NSAutoreleasePool worked was a bit weird, as creating it caused an effect throughout the whole application; @autoreleasepool creates a scoped area and makes it clearer what's within the pool and when it drains (when it goes out of scope). It's also more efficient according to Apple.

- Weak

weak is similar to strong except that it won't increase the reference count by 1. It does not become an owner of that object but just holds a reference to it. If the object's reference count drops to 0, even though you may still be pointing to it here, it will be deallocated from memory.

- release
- autorelease

</details>

Keeps track of the strong references and when this number gets to 0 release the memory
A weak reference is a reference that does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to, and so does not stop ARC from disposing of the referenced instance. This behavior prevents the reference from becoming part of a strong reference cycle. You indicate a weak reference by placing the weak keyword before a property or variable declaration.

Like a weak reference, an unowned reference does not keep a strong hold on the instance it refers to. Unlike a weak reference, however, an unowned reference is used when the other instance has the same lifetime or a longer lifetime. You indicate an unowned reference by placing the unowned keyword before a property or variable declaration.

```swift
lazy var someClosure: () -> String = {
    [unowned self, weak delegate = self.delegate!] in
    // closure body goes here
}
```

Dependencies
The NSOperation API provides support for dependencies. This is a powerful concept that enables developers to execute tasks in a specific order. An operation is ready when every dependency has finished executing.

Observable
The NSOperation and NSOperationQueue classes have a number of properties that can be observed, using KVO (Key Value Observing). This is another important benefit if you want to monitor the state of an operation or operation queue.

Pause, Cancel, Resume
Operations can be paused, resumed, and cancelled. Once you dispatch a task using Grand Central Dispatch, you no longer have control or insight into the execution of that task. The NSOperation API is more flexible in that respect, giving the developer control over the operation's life cycle.

Control
The NSOperationQueue also adds a number of benefits to the mix. For example, you can specify the maximum number of queued operations that can run simultaneously. This makes it easy to control how many operations run at the same time or to create a serial operation queue.

Grand Central Dispatch is ideal if you just need to dispatch a block of code to a serial or concurrent queue. If you don't want to go through the hassle of creating an NSOperation subclass for a trivial task, then Grand Central Dispatch is a great alternative. Another benefit of Grand Central Dispatch is that you can keep related code together. Take a look at the following example.

<details><summary>Properties</summary>
	
1. Stored properties store constant and variable values as part of an instance(C, S)
 - Instances of a struct with let will not allow change the properties eventhough there are var, which is not true for class
2. Computed properties calculate (rather than store) a value(C, S, E). Instead, they provide a getter and an optional setter to retrieve and set other properties and values indirectly.
 - A lazy stored property is a property whose initial value is not calculated until the first time it is used

3. Type properties - properties can also be associated with the type itsel.

```swift
var center: Point {
        get {
            let centerX = origin.x + (size.width / 2)
            let centerY = origin.y + (size.height / 2)
            return Point(x: centerX, y: centerY)
        }
        set(newCenter) {
	set {
            origin.x = newCenter.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newCenter.y - (size.height / 2)
        }
    }
```

You must declare computed properties—including read-only computed properties—as variable properties with the var keyword, because their value is not fixed. The let keyword is only used for constant properties, to indicate that their values cannot be changed once they are set as part of instance initialization.

4. Property observers can be added to stored properties you define

```swift 
class StepCounter {
    var totalSteps: Int = 0 {
        willSet(newTotalSteps) {
            print("About to set totalSteps to \(newTotalSteps)")
        }
        didSet {
            if totalSteps > oldValue  {
                print("Added \(totalSteps - oldValue) steps")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
If you pass a property that has observers to a function as an in-out parameter, the willSet and didSet observers are always called. This is because of the copy-in copy-out memory model for in-out parameters: The value is always written back to the property at the end of the function.

<details><summary>Initializers</summary>
	Memberwise, Default, Convinience, Designated, Faileable, Required, 
	
	
	Classes and structures must set all of their stored properties to an appropriate initial value by the time an instance of that class or structure is created. Stored properties cannot be left in an indeterminate state.

You can set an initial value for a stored property within an initializer, or by assigning a default property value as part of the property’s definition. 
deinitializer
```swift
struct Fahrenheit {
    var temperature: Double
    init() {
        temperature = 32.0
    }
}
var f = Fahrenheit()
print("The default temperature is \(f.temperature)° Fahrenheit")
```
or
```swift
struct Fahrenheit {
    var temperature = 32.0
}
```

Initialization Parameters

You can assign a value to a constant property at any point during initialization, as long as it is set to a definite value by the time initialization finishes. Once a constant property is assigned a value, it can’t be further modified.

Swift provides a default initializer for any structure or class that provides default values for all of its properties and does not provide at least one initializer itself. The default initializer simply creates a new instance with all of its properties set to their default values.

Structure types automatically receive a memberwise initializer if they do not define any of their own custom initializers. Unlike a default initializer, the structure receives a memberwise initializer even if it has stored properties that do not have default values.

Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an instance’s initialization. This process, known as initializer delegation, avoids duplicating code across multiple initializers.

Note that if you define a custom initializer for a value type, you will no longer have access to the default initializer (or the memberwise initializer, if it is a structure) for that type.

 --Classes vs Struct initializers

You can initialize the Rect structure below in one of three ways—by using its default zero-initialized origin and size property values, by providing a specific origin point and size, or by providing a specific center point and size. These initialization options are represented by three custom initializers that are part of the Rect structure’s definition

```swift
struct Rect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    init() {}
    init(origin: Point, size: Size) {
        self.origin = origin
        self.size = size
    }
    init(center: Point, size: Size) {
        let originX = center.x - (size.width / 2)
        let originY = center.y - (size.height / 2)
        self.init(origin: Point(x: originX, y: originY), size: size)
    }
}
```

All of a class’s stored properties—including any properties the class inherits from its superclass—must be assigned an initial value during initialization.

Swift defines two kinds of initializers for class types to help ensure all stored properties receive an initial value. These are known as designated initializers and convenience initializers.


Designated initializers are the primary initializers for a class. A designated initializer fully initializes all properties introduced by that class and calls an appropriate superclass initializer to continue the initialization process up the superclass chain.

Classes tend to have very few designated initializers, and it is quite common for a class to have only one. Designated initializers are “funnel” points through which initialization takes place, and through which the initialization process continues up the superclass chain.

Every class must have at least one designated initializer. In some cases, this requirement is satisfied by inheriting one or more designated initializers from a superclass, as described in Automatic Initializer Inheritance below.

Convenience initializers are secondary, supporting initializers for a class. You can define a convenience initializer to call a designated initializer from the same class as the convenience initializer with some of the designated initializer’s parameters set to default values. You can also define a convenience initializer to create an instance of that class for a specific use case or input value type.

You do not have to provide convenience initializers if your class does not require them. Create convenience initializers whenever a shortcut to a common initialization pattern will save time or make initialization of the class clearer in intent.
```swift
 init() {
 }
 
convenience init() {
 }
```

To simplify the relationships between designated and convenience initializers, Swift applies the following three rules for delegation calls between initializers:

Rule 1
A designated initializer must call a designated initializer from its immediate superclass.

Rule 2
A convenience initializer must call another initializer from the same class.

Rule 3
A convenience initializer must ultimately call a designated initializer.

A simple way to remember this is:

Designated initializers must always delegate up.

Convenience initializers must always delegate across.



Two-Phase Initialization
Class initialization in Swift is a two-phase process. In the first phase, each stored property is assigned an initial value by the class that introduced it. Once the initial state for every stored property has been determined, the second phase begins, and each class is given the opportunity to customize its stored properties further before the new instance is considered ready for use.

The use of a two-phase initialization process makes initialization safe, while still giving complete flexibility to each class in a class hierarchy. Two-phase initialization prevents property values from being accessed before they are initialized, and prevents property values from being set to a different value by another initializer unexpectedly.

Swift’s compiler performs four helpful safety-checks to make sure that two-phase initialization is completed without error:

Safety check 1
A designated initializer must ensure that all of the properties introduced by its class are initialized before it delegates up to a superclass initializer.

As mentioned above, the memory for an object is only considered fully initialized once the initial state of all of its stored properties is known. In order for this rule to be satisfied, a designated initializer must make sure that all of its own properties are initialized before it hands off up the chain.

Safety check 2
A designated initializer must delegate up to a superclass initializer before assigning a value to an inherited property. If it doesn’t, the new value the designated initializer assigns will be overwritten by the superclass as part of its own initialization.

Safety check 3
A convenience initializer must delegate to another initializer before assigning a value to any property (including properties defined by the same class). If it doesn’t, the new value the convenience initializer assigns will be overwritten by its own class’s designated initializer.

Safety check 4
An initializer cannot call any instance methods, read the values of any instance properties, or refer to self as a value until after the first phase of initialization is complete.

The class instance is not fully valid until the first phase ends. Properties can only be accessed, and methods can only be called, once the class instance is known to be valid at the end of the first phase.

Here’s how two-phase initialization plays out, based on the four safety checks above:

Phase 1

A designated or convenience initializer is called on a class.

Memory for a new instance of that class is allocated. The memory is not yet initialized.

A designated initializer for that class confirms that all stored properties introduced by that class have a value. The memory for these stored properties is now initialized.

The designated initializer hands off to a superclass initializer to perform the same task for its own stored properties.

This continues up the class inheritance chain until the top of the chain is reached.

Once the top of the chain is reached, and the final class in the chain has ensured that all of its stored properties have a value, the instance’s memory is considered to be fully initialized, and phase 1 is complete.

Phase 2

Working back down from the top of the chain, each designated initializer in the chain has the option to customize the instance further. Initializers are now able to access self and can modify its properties, call its instance methods, and so on.

Finally, any convenience initializers in the chain have the option to customize the instance and to work with self.


Conversely, if you write a subclass initializer that matches a superclass convenience initializer, that superclass convenience initializer can never be called directly by your subclass, as per the rules


Automatic Initializer Inheritance
As mentioned above, subclasses do not inherit their superclass initializers by default. However, superclass initializers are automatically inherited if certain conditions are met. In practice, this means that you do not need to write initializer overrides in many common scenarios, and can inherit your superclass initializers with minimal effort whenever it is safe to do so.

Assuming that you provide default values for any new properties you introduce in a subclass, the following two rules apply:

Rule 1
If your subclass doesn’t define any designated initializers, it automatically inherits all of its superclass designated initializers.

Rule 2
If your subclass provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers—either by inheriting them as per rule 1, or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definition—then it automatically inherits all of the superclass convenience initializers.

Failable Initializers
It is sometimes useful to define a class, structure, or enumeration for which initialization can fail. This failure might be triggered by invalid initialization parameter values, the absence of a required external resource, or some other condition that prevents initialization from succeeding.

To cope with initialization conditions that can fail, define one or more failable initializers as part of a class, structure, or enumeration definition. You write a failable initializer by placing a question mark after the init keyword (init?).

<details><summary>Closures</summary>
Global and nested functions, as introduced in Functions, are actually special cases of closures. Closures take one of three forms:

Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values.

Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.

Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.

Swift’s closure expressions have a clean, clear style, with optimizations that encourage brief, clutter-free syntax in common scenarios. These optimizations include:

Inferring parameter and return value types from context

Implicit returns from single-expression closures

Shorthand argument names

Trailing closure syntax

@escaping 
A closure is said to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument to the function, but is called after the function returns. When you declare a function that takes a closure as one of its parameters, you can write @escaping before the parameter’s type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape.
Marking a closure with @escaping means you have to refer to self explicitly within the closure. For example, in the code below, the closure passed to someFunctionWithEscapingClosure(_:) is an escaping closure, which means it needs to refer to self explicitly. In contrast, the closure passed to someFunctionWithNonescapingClosure(_:) is a nonescaping closure, which means it can refer to self implicitly.

@autoclosure
An autoclosure is a closure that is automatically created to wrap an expression that’s being passed as an argument to a function. It doesn’t take any arguments, and when it’s called, it returns the value of the expression that’s wrapped inside of it. This syntactic convenience lets you omit braces around a function’s parameter by writing a normal expression instead of an explicit closure.

Functions can be assigned to variables and passed in and out of other functions as argument, just as an int or a string can be
Functions can capture variables that exist outside of their local scope
There are two ways of creating functions - either with the func word , or with {} - closure expression.

Hugging => content does not want to grow
Compression Resistance => content does not want to shrink
After solving for the required constraints, Auto Layout tries to solve all the optional constraints in priority order from highest to lowest. If it cannot solve for an optional constraint, it tries to come as close as possible to the desired result, and then moves on to the next constraint.

This combination of inequalities, equalities, and priorities gives you a great amount of flexibility and power. By combining multiple constraints, you can define layouts that dynamically adapt as the size and location of the elements in your user interface change.

<details><summary>Nonatomic,Copy,Assign, Retain,Strong,Weak</summary>
Nonatomic

nonatomic is used for multi threading purposes. If we have set the nonatomic attribute at the time of declaration, then any other thread wanting access to that object can access it and give results in respect to multi-threading.

Copy

copy is required when the object is mutable. Use this if you need the value of the object as it is at this moment, and you don't want that value to reflect any changes made by other owners of the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it because you are retaining the copy.

Assign

Assign is somewhat the opposite to copy. When calling the getter of an assign property, it returns a reference to the actual data. Typically you use this attribute when you have a property of primitive type (float, int, BOOL...)

Retain

retain is required when the attribute is a pointer to an object. The setter generated by @synthesize will retain (aka add a retain count to) the object. You will need to release the object when you are finished with it. By using retain it will increase the retain count and occupy memory in autorelease pool.

Strong

strong is a replacement for the retain attribute, as part of Objective-C Automated Reference Counting (ARC). In non-ARC code it's just a synonym for retain.

This is a good website to learn about strong and weak for iOS 5. http://www.raywenderlich.com/5677/beginning-arc-in-ios-5-part-1

Weak

weak is similar to strong except that it won't increase the reference count by 1. It does not become an owner of that object but just holds a reference to it. If the object's reference count drops to 0, even though you may still be pointing to it here, it will be deallocated from memory.

• Using InterfaceBuilder, you can add a XIB file to your project, layout elements within it, and then load the XIB in your application code (either automatically, based on naming conventions, or manually). Also, using InterfaceBuilder you can create a storyboard for your application.

<details> 
  <summary>Does Objective-C contain private methods?</summary>
NO, there is nothing called a private method in Object-C programming. If a method is defined in .m only then it becomes protected. If in .h,it is public.
If you really want a private method then you need to add a local category/ unnamed category/ class extension in the class and add the method in the category and define it in the class.m</details>
<details> 
  <summary>What is plist?</summary>
Plist refers to Property lists that organize data into named values and lists of values using several object types. These types provide you the means to produce data that is meaningfully structured, transportable, storable, and accessible, but still as efficient as possible. Property lists are frequently used by applications running on both Mac OS X and iOS. The property-list programming interfaces for Cocoa and Core Foundation allow you to convert hierarchically structured combinations of these basic types of objects to and from standard XML. You can save the XML data to disk and later use it to reconstruct the original objects.
The user defaults system, which you programmatically access through the NSUserDefaults class, uses property lists to store objects representing user preferences. This limitation would seem to exclude many kinds of objects like as NSColor and NSFont objects, from the user default system. But if objects conform to the NSCoding protocol they can be archived to NSData objects, which are property list–compatible objects</details>

<details> 
  <summary>What is the difference between an “app ID” and a “bundle ID” and what is each used for?</summary>
Since most users consider the App ID as string, they think it is interchangeable with Bundle ID. Once the App ID is created in the Member Center, you can only use the App ID Prefix that matches the Bundle ID of the Application Bundle.
The bundle ID uniquely defines each App. It is specified in Xcode. A single Xcode project can have multiple targets and therefore, output multiple apps. A common use case for this – An app having both lite/free and pro/full versions or branded multiple ways.</details>
<details> 
  <summary>What is Abstract class in Cocoa?</summary>
Cocoa doesn’t provide anything called abstract. We can create a class abstract that gets checked only at runtime while it is not checked at compile time.
@interface AbstractClass : NSObject
@end
@implementation AbstractClass
+ (id)alloc{
    if (self == [AbstractClass class]) {
        NSLog(@"Abstract Class can’t be used");
    }
    return [super alloc];
@end</details>
<details> 
  <summary>What is NSURLConnection class? Define its types and use case.</summary>
There are two ways of using NSURLConnection class. One is asynchronous and the other is synchronous.
An asynchronous connection will create a new thread and performs its download process on the new thread. A synchronous connection will block the calling thread while downloading content and doing its communication.
Many developers think that a synchronous connection blocks the main thread, which is not true. A synchronous connection will always block the thread from which it is fired. If you fire a synchronous connection from the main thread, the main thread will be blocked. But, if you fire a synchronous connection from a thread other than the main thread, it will be like an asynchronous connection and won’t block your main thread.
In fact, the only difference between a synchronous and an asynchronous connection is that at runtime, a thread will be created for the asynchronous connection while it won’t do the same for a synchronous connection.
In order to create an asynchronous connection, we need to do the following:
1. Have our URL in an instance of NSString
2. Convert our string to an instance of NSURL
3. Place our URL in a URL Request of type NSURLRequest, or in the case of mutable URLs, in an instance of NSMutableURLRequest.
4. Create an instance of NSURLConnection and pass the URL request to it.</details>
<details> 
  <summary>What is the relation between iVar and @property?</summary>
iVar is an instance variables. It cannot be accessed unless we create accessors, which are generated by @property. iVar and its counterpart @property can be of different names.
@interface Box : NSObject{
    NSString *boxName;
}
@property (strong) NSString *boxDescription;//this will become another ivar
-(void)aMethod;
@end
@implementation Box
@synthesize boxDescription=boxName;//now boxDescription is accessor for name
-(void)aMethod {
    NSLog(@"name=%@", boxName);
     NSLog(@"boxDescription=%@",self.boxDescription);
    NSLog(@"boxDescription=%@",boxDescription); //throw an error
}
@end</details>

  <summary>
What happens if IApplication object does not handle an event?
</summary>
In such case the event will be dispatched to your app delegate for processing.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
Name the framework that is used to construct application's user interface for iOS?
</summary>
The UIKit framework is used to develop application's user interface for iOS. UIKit framework provides event handling, drawing model, windows, views, and controls specifically designed for a touch screen interface.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
How is the app delegate is declared by Xcode project templates?
</summary>
App delegate is declared as a subclass of UIResponder by Xcode project templates.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
How can you respond to state transitions on your app?
</summary>
On state transitions can be responded to state changes in an appropriate way by calling corresponding methods on app's delegate object.

For example:
application Did Become Active method can be used to prepare to run as the foreground app.
application Did Enter Background method can be used to execute some code when app is running in the background and may be suspended at any time.
application Will Enter Foreground method can be used to execute some code when your app is moving out of the background application Will Terminate method is called when your app is being terminated.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
When an app is said to be in active state?
</summary>
An app is said to be in active state when it is running in foreground and is receiving events.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
Assume that your app is running in the foreground but is currently not receiving events. In which sate it would be in?
</summary>
An app will be in InActive state if it is running in the foreground but is currently not receiving events. An app stays in InActive state only briefly as it transitions to a different state.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
Give example scenarios when an application goes into InActive state?
</summary>
An app can get into InActive state when the user locks the screen or the system prompts the user to respond to some event e.g. SMS message, incoming call etc.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
List down apps state transitions when it gets launched?
</summary>
Before the launch of an app, it is said to be in not running state.
When an app is launched, it moves to the active or background state, after transitioning briefly through the inactive state.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
Who calls the main function of you app during the app launch cycle?
</summary>
During app launching, the system creates a main thread for the app and calls the app's main function on that main thread. The Xcode project's default main function hands over control to the UIKit framework, which takes care of initializing the app before it is run.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>How can you respond to state transitions on your app?</summary>
State transitions can be responded to state changes in an appropriate way by calling corresponding methods on app’s delegate object.
For example:
applicationDidBecomeActive( ) method can be used to prepare to run as the foreground app.
applicationDidEnterBackground( ) method can be used to execute some code when app is running in the background and may be suspended at any time.
applicationWillEnterForeground( ) method can be used to execute some code when your app is moving out of the background
applicationWillTerminate( ) method is called when your app is being terminated.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>What is the difference between retain & assign?</summary>
Assign creates a reference from one object to another without increasing the source’s retain count.
if (_variable != object)
{   
 [_variable release];  
  _variable = nil;  
  _variable = object;
 }
Retain creates a reference from one object to another and increases the retain count of the source object.
if (_variable != object)
{
  [_variable release];
    _variable = nil;  
_variable = [object retain];  
}</details>

<details>

<details> 
  <summary>
How to change the content of your app in order to change the views displayed in the corresponding window?
</summary>
To change the content of your app, you use a view controller to change the views displayed in the corresponding window. Remember, window itself is never replaced.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
Difference between shallow copy and deep copy?
</summary>
Shallow copy is also known as address copy. In this process you only copy address not actual data while in deep copy you copy data.
Suppose there are two objects A and B. A is pointing to a different array while B is pointing to different array. Now what I will do is following to do shallow copy.
Char *A = {‘a','b','c'};
Char *B = {‘x','y','z'};
B = A;
Now B is pointing is at same location where A pointer is pointing.Both A and B in this case sharing same data. if change is made both will get altered value of data.Advantage is that coping process is very fast and is independent of size of array.
while in deep copy data is also copied. This process is slow but Both A and B have their own copies and changes made to any copy, other will copy will not be affected.</details>

<details> 
  <summary>
Which app specific objects store the apps content?
</summary>
Data model objects are app specific objects and store app's content. Apps can also use document objects to manage some or all of their data model objects.</details>

<details>

How will you implement a particular view which has lots of elements for various screen sizes. imagine a view has lots of elements where it scrolls for pages and pages. How will you retrieve the data? Will you retrieve it all at once or not? If not then how will you retrieve it? imagine a view has a UIImageView as it's subview. How will you query the server to send the image in a particular size? since you will have millions of requests going to the server and if each of the requests asks for the same size, then how will you make sure that the resizing on the server happens just once? imagine we had a view with lots of images and each image below it had name of the image. How will you implement it? How and when will you retrieve the images? What would you do if you had to make sure that at any given time, there are at max 4 requests that goes out? NP-complete "Partition Problem". Given an array of positive integers, divide it into two arrays A1 and A2 such that the sum of elements of A1 is equal to sum to elements of A2.

## ML
<details> 
  <summary>What’s the trade-off between bias and variance? </summary>

Bias is error due to erroneous or overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm you’re using. This can lead to the model underfitting your data, making it hard for it to have high predictive accuracy and for you to generalize your knowledge from the training set to the test set.

Variance is error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm you’re using. This leads to the algorithm being highly sensitive to high degrees of variation in your training data, which can lead your model to overfit the data. You’ll be carrying too much noise from your training data for your model to be very useful for your test data.

The bias-variance decomposition essentially decomposes the learning error from any algorithm by adding the bias, the variance and a bit of irreducible error due to noise in the underlying dataset. Essentially, if you make the model more complex and add more variables, you’ll lose bias but gain some variance — in order to get the optimally reduced amount of error, you’ll have to tradeoff bias and variance. You don’t want either high bias or high variance in your model.
</details> 

<details> 
  <summary>What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning?</summary>

More reading: What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? (Quora)

Supervised learning requires training labeled data. For example, in order to do classification (a supervised learning task), you’ll need to first label the data you’ll use to train the model to classify data into your labeled groups. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, does not require labeling data explicitly.
</details> 


<details> 
  <summary>How is KNN different from k-means clustering?</summary>

K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised classification algorithm, while k-means clustering is an unsupervised clustering algorithm. While the mechanisms may seem similar at first, what this really means is that in order for K-Nearest Neighbors to work, you need labeled data you want to classify an unlabeled point into (thus the nearest neighbor part). K-means clustering requires only a set of unlabeled points and a threshold: the algorithm will take unlabeled points and gradually learn how to cluster them into groups by computing the mean of the distance between different points.

The critical difference here is that KNN needs labeled points and is thus supervised learning, while k-means doesn’t — and is thus unsupervised learning.
</details> 

<details> 
  <summary>Explain how a ROC curve works.</summary>

The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the contrast between true positive rates and the false positive rate at various thresholds. It’s often used as a proxy for the trade-off between the sensitivity of the model (true positives) vs the fall-out or the probability it will trigger a false alarm (false positives).
</details> 

<details> 
  <summary>Define precision and recall.</summary>
Recall is also known as the true positive rate: the amount of positives your model claims compared to the actual number of positives there are throughout the data. Precision is also known as the positive predictive value, and it is a measure of the amount of accurate positives your model claims compared to the number of positives it actually claims. It can be easier to think of recall and precision in the context of a case where you’ve predicted that there were 10 apples and 5 oranges in a case of 10 apples. You’d have perfect recall (there are actually 10 apples, and you predicted there would be 10) but 66.7% precision because out of the 15 events you predicted, only 10 (the apples) are correct.

  <summary>What is Bayes’ Theorem? How is it useful in a machine learning context?</summary>
Bayes’ Theorem gives you the posterior probability of an event given what is known as prior knowledge.

Mathematically, it’s expressed as the true positive rate of a condition sample divided by the sum of the false positive rate of the population and the true positive rate of a condition. Say you had a 60% chance of actually having the flu after a flu test, but out of people who had the flu, the test will be false 50% of the time, and the overall population only has a 5% chance of having the flu. Would you actually have a 60% chance of having the flu after having a positive test?

Bayes’ Theorem says no. It says that you have a (.6 * 0.05) (True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) / (.6*0.05)(True Positive Rate of a Condition Sample) + (.5*0.95) (False Positive Rate of a Population)  = 0.0594 or 5.94% chance of getting a flu.

Bayes’ Theorem is the basis behind a branch of machine learning that most notably includes the Naive Bayes classifier. That’s something important to consider when you’re faced with machine learning interview questions.
</details> 

<details> 
  <summary>Why is “Naive” Bayes naive?</summary>
Despite its practical applications, especially in text mining, Naive Bayes is considered “Naive” because it makes an assumption that is virtually impossible to see in real-life data: the conditional probability is calculated as the pure product of the individual probabilities of components. This implies the absolute independence of features — a condition probably never met in real life.

As a Quora commenter put it whimsically, a Naive Bayes classifier that figured out that you liked pickles and ice cream would probably naively recommend you a pickle ice cream.

  <summary>Explain the difference between L1 and L2 regularization.</summary>
L2 regularization tends to spread error among all the terms, while L1 is more binary/sparse, with many variables either being assigned a 1 or 0 in weighting. L1 corresponds to setting a Laplacean prior on the terms, while L2 corresponds to a Gaussian prior.

<details> 
 <summary>What’s the difference between Type I and Type II error?</summary>
Don’t think that this is a trick question! Many machine learning interview questions will be an attempt to lob basic questions at you just to make sure you’re on top of your game and you’ve prepared all of your bases.

Type I error is a false positive, while Type II error is a false negative. Briefly stated, Type I error means claiming something has happened when it hasn’t, while Type II error means that you claim nothing is happening when in fact something is.

A clever way to think about this is to think of Type I error as telling a man he is pregnant, while Type II error means you tell a pregnant woman she isn’t carrying a baby.

 <summary>What’s a Fourier transform?</summary>
A Fourier transform is a generic method to decompose generic functions into a superposition of symmetric functions. Or as this more intuitive tutorial puts it, given a smoothie, it’s how we find the recipe. The Fourier transform finds the set of cycle speeds, amplitudes and phases to match any time signal. A Fourier transform converts a signal from time to frequency domain — it’s a very common way to extract features from audio signals or other time series such as sensor data.
</details> 

<details> 
 <summary>What’s the difference between probability and likelihood?</summary>
The answer depends on whether you are dealing with discrete or continuous random variables. So, I will split my answer accordingly. I will assume that you want some technical details and not necessarily an explanation in plain English. If my assumption is not correct please let me know and I will revise my answer.

Discrete Random Variables

Suppose that you have a stochastic process that takes discrete values (e.g., outcomes of tossing a coin 10 times, number of customers who arrive at a store in 10 minutes etc). In such cases, we can calculate the probability of observing a particular set of outcomes by making suitable assumptions about the underlying stochastic process (e.g., probability of coin landing heads is p and that coin tosses are independent).

Denote the observed outcomes by O and the set of parameters that describe the stochastic process as θ. Thus, when we speak of probability we want to calculate P(O|θ). In other words, given specific values for θ, P(O|θ) is the probability that we would observe the outcomes represented by O.

However, when we model a real life stochastic process, we often do not know θ. We simply observe O and the goal then is to arrive at an estimate for θ that would be a plausible choice given the observed outcomes O. We know that given a value of θ the probability of observing O is P(O|θ). Thus, a 'natural' estimation process is to choose that value of θ that would maximize the probability that we would actually observe O. In other words, we find the parameter values θ that maximize the following function:

L(θ|O)=P(O|θ)
L(θ|O) is called the likelihood function. Notice that by definition the likelihood function is conditioned on the observed O and that it is a function of the unknown parameters θ.

Continuous Random Variables

In the continuous case the situation is similar with one important difference. We can no longer talk about the probability that we observed O given θ because in the continuous case P(O|θ)=0. Without getting into technicalities, the basic idea is as follows:

Denote the probability density function (pdf) associated with the outcomes O as: f(O|θ). Thus, in the continuous case we estimate θ given observed outcomes O by maximizing the following function:

L(θ|O)=f(O|θ)
In this situation, we cannot technically assert that we are finding the parameter value that maximizes the probability that we observe O as we maximize the PDF associated with the observed outcomes O.

<details> 
 <summary>What is deep learning, and how does it contrast with other machine learning algorithms?</summary>
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is concerned with neural networks: how to use backpropagation and certain principles from neuroscience to more accurately model large sets of unlabelled or semi-structured data. In that sense, deep learning represents an unsupervised learning algorithm that learns representations of data through the use of neural nets.
</details> 

<details> 
 <summary>What cross-validation technique would you use on a time series dataset?</summary>
Instead of using standard k-folds cross-validation, you have to pay attention to the fact that a time series is not randomly distributed data — it is inherently ordered by chronological order. If a pattern emerges in later time periods for example, your model may still pick up on it even if that effect doesn’t hold in earlier years!

You’ll want to do something like forward chaining where you’ll be able to model on past data then look at forward-facing data.

- fold 1 : training [1], test [2]
- fold 2 : training [1 2], test [3]
- fold 3 : training [1 2 3], test [4]
- fold 4 : training [1 2 3 4], test [5]
- fold 5 : training [1 2 3 4 5], test [6]
</details> 


<details> 
 <summary>How is a decision tree pruned?</summary>
Pruning is what happens in decision trees when branches that have weak predictive power are removed in order to reduce the complexity of the model and increase the predictive accuracy of a decision tree model. Pruning can happen bottom-up and top-down, with approaches such as reduced error pruning and cost complexity pruning.

Reduced error pruning is perhaps the simplest version: replace each node. If it doesn’t decrease predictive accuracy, keep it pruned. While simple, this heuristic actually comes pretty close to an approach that would optimize for maximum accuracy.
</details> 

<details> 
 <summary>Which is more important to you– model accuracy, or model performance?</summary>
This question tests your grasp of the nuances of machine learning model performance! Machine learning interview questions often look towards the details. There are models with higher accuracy that can perform worse in predictive power — how does that make sense?

Well, it has everything to do with how model accuracy is only a subset of model performance, and at that, a sometimes misleading one. For example, if you wanted to detect fraud in a massive dataset with a sample of millions, a more accurate model would most likely predict no fraud at all if only a vast minority of cases were fraud. However, this would be useless for a predictive model — a model designed to find fraud that asserted there was no fraud at all! Questions like this help you demonstrate that you understand model accuracy isn’t the be-all and end-all of model performance.
</details> 


<details> 
 <summary>What’s the F1 score? How would you use it?</summary>
The F1 score is a measure of a model’s performance. It is a weighted average of the precision and recall of a model, with results tending to 1 being the best, and those tending to 0 being the worst. You would use it in classification tests where true negatives don’t matter much.
</details> 

<details> 
 <summary>How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?</summary>
An imbalanced dataset is when you have, for example, a classification test and 90% of the data is in one class. That leads to problems: an accuracy of 90% can be skewed if you have no predictive power on the other category of data! Here are a few tactics to get over the hump:

1- Collect more data to even the imbalances in the dataset.

2- Resample the dataset to correct for imbalances.

3- Try a different algorithm altogether on your dataset.

What’s important here is that you have a keen sense for what damage an unbalanced dataset can cause, and how to balance that.
</details> 


<details> 
 <summary> When should you use classification over regression?</summary>
Classification produces discrete values and dataset to strict categories, while regression gives you continuous results that allow you to better distinguish differences between individual points. You would use classification over regression if you wanted your results to reflect the belongingness of data points in your dataset to certain explicit categories (ex: If you wanted to know whether a name was male or female rather than just how correlated they were with male and female names.)
</details> 


<details> 
 <summary>Name an example where ensemble techniques might be useful.</summary>
Ensemble techniques use a combination of learning algorithms to optimize better predictive performance. They typically reduce overfitting in models and make the model more robust (unlikely to be influenced by small changes in the training data). 

You could list some examples of ensemble methods, from bagging to boosting to a “bucket of models” method and demonstrate how they could increase predictive power.
</details> 


<details> 
 <summary>How do you ensure you’re not overfitting with a model?</summary>


More reading: How can I avoid overfitting? (Quora)

This is a simple restatement of a fundamental problem in machine learning: the possibility of overfitting training data and carrying the noise of that data through to the test set, thereby providing inaccurate generalizations.

There are three main methods to avoid overfitting:

1- Keep the model simpler: reduce variance by taking into account fewer variables and parameters, thereby removing some of the noise in the training data.

2- Use cross-validation techniques such as k-folds cross-validation.

3- Use regularization techniques such as LASSO that penalize certain model parameters if they’re likely to cause overfitting.
</details> 

<details>
<summary>What evaluation approaches would you work to gauge the effectiveness of a machine learning model?</summary>
You would first split the dataset into training and test sets, or perhaps use cross-validation techniques to further segment the dataset into composite sets of training and test sets within the data. You should then implement a choice selection of performance metrics: here is a fairly comprehensive list. You could use measures such as the F1 score, the accuracy, and the confusion matrix. What’s important here is to demonstrate that you understand the nuances of how a model is measured and how to choose the right performance measures for the right situations.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How would you evaluate a logistic regression model?</summary>
A subsection of the question above. You have to demonstrate an understanding of what the typical goals of a logistic regression are (classification, prediction etc.) and bring up a few examples and use cases.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What’s the “kernel trick” and how is it useful?</summary>
The Kernel trick involves kernel functions that can enable in higher-dimension spaces without explicitly calculating the coordinates of points within that dimension: instead, kernel functions compute the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in a feature space. This allows them the very useful attribute of calculating the coordinates of higher dimensions while being computationally cheaper than the explicit calculation of said coordinates. Many algorithms can be expressed in terms of inner products. Using the kernel trick enables us effectively run  algorithms in a high-dimensional space with lower-dimensional data.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset?</summary>
You could find missing/corrupted data in a dataset and either drop those rows or columns, or decide to replace them with another value.

In Pandas, there are two very useful methods: isnull() and dropna() that will help you find columns of data with missing or corrupted data and drop those values. If you want to fill the invalid values with a placeholder value (for example, 0), you could use the fillna() method.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you have experience with Spark or big data tools for machine learning?</summary>
You’ll want to get familiar with the meaning of big data for different companies and the different tools they’ll want. Spark is the big data tool most in demand now, able to handle immense datasets with speed. Be honest if you don’t have experience with the tools demanded, but also take a look at job descriptions and see what tools pop up: you’ll want to invest in familiarizing yourself with them.

<summary>What are some differences between a linked list and an array?</summary>
An array is an ordered collection of objects. A linked list is a series of objects with pointers that direct how to process them sequentially. An array assumes that every element has the same size, unlike the linked list. A linked list can more easily grow organically: an array has to be pre-defined or re-defined for organic growth. Shuffling a linked list involves changing which points direct where — meanwhile, shuffling an array is more complex and takes more memory.

<summary>Describe a hash table.</summary>
A hash table is a data structure that produces an associative array. A key is mapped to certain values through the use of a hash function. They are often used for tasks such as database indexing.


</details>


<details>
<summary>Which data visualization libraries do you use? What are your thoughts on the best data visualization tools?</summary>
What’s important here is to define your views on how to properly visualize data and your personal preferences when it comes to tools. Popular tools include R’s ggplot, Python’s seaborn and matplotlib, and tools such as Plot.ly and Tableau.

<summary>How would you implement a recommendation system for our company’s users?</summary>
A lot of machine learning interview questions of this type will involve implementation of machine learning models to a company’s problems. You’ll have to research the company and its industry in-depth, especially the revenue drivers the company has, and the types of users the company takes on in the context of the industry it’s in.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can we use your machine learning skills to generate revenue?</summary>
This is a tricky question. The ideal answer would demonstrate knowledge of what drives the business and how your skills could relate. For example, if you were interviewing for music-streaming startup Spotify, you could remark that your skills at developing a better recommendation model would increase user retention, which would then increase revenue in the long run.

The startup metrics Slideshare linked above will help you understand exactly what performance indicators are important for startups and tech companies as they think about revenue and growth.

<details>
<summary>What do you think of our current data process?</summary>
This kind of question requires you to listen carefully and impart feedback in a manner that is constructive and insightful. Your interviewer is trying to gauge if you’d be a valuable member of their team and whether you grasp the nuances of why certain things are set the way they are in the company’s data process based on company- or industry-specific conditions. They’re trying to see if you can be an intellectual peer. Act accordingly.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the last machine learning papers you’ve read?</summary>
Keeping up with the latest scientific literature on machine learning is a must if you want to demonstrate interest in a machine learning position. This overview of deep learning in Nature by the scions of deep learning themselves (from Hinton to Bengio to LeCun) can be a good reference paper and an overview of what’s happening in deep learning — and the kind of paper you might want to cite.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do you have research experience in machine learning?</summary>
Related to the last point, most organizations hiring for machine learning positions will look for your formal experience in the field. Research papers, co-authored or supervised by leaders in the field, can make the difference between you being hired and not. Make sure you have a summary of your research experience and papers ready — and an explanation for your background and lack of formal research experience if you don’t.

</details>

<summary>How would you approach the “Netflix Prize” competition?</summary>
The Netflix Prize was a famed competition where Netflix offered $1,000,000 for a better collaborative filtering algorithm. The team that won called BellKor had a 10% improvement and used an ensemble of different methods to win. Some familiarity with the case and its solution will help demonstrate you’ve paid attention to machine learning for a while.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where do you usually source datasets?</summary>
Machine learning interview questions like these try to get at the heart of your machine learning interest. Somebody who is truly passionate about machine learning will have gone off and done side projects on their own, and have a good idea of what great datasets are out there. If you’re missing any, check out Quandl for economic and financial data, and Kaggle’s Datasets collection for another great list.

```swift

a = [(1,2),(2,3),(100,5)]
b = [(0,5),(1,1),(100,6)]

i = 0; j = 0
result = 0
while i < len(a) and j < len(b):
    if a[i][0] == b[j][0]:
        result += a[i][1] * b[j][1]
        i += 1
